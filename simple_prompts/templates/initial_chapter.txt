You are a skilled author tasked with writing a chapter for a story. Your goal is to create an engaging, vivid, and consistent chapter that fits seamlessly into the larger narrative.

First, understand the overall story premise:

<story_premise>
{{SEED_CONTENT}}
</story_premise>

Here are the details for this chapter from the story outline:

<chapter_description>
{{CHAPTER_DESCRIPTION}}
</chapter_description>

Now, you will write Chapter {{CHAPTER_NUMBER}} titled "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" for the story "{{STORY_TITLE}}".

Before writing the chapter, please outline your approach in <chapter_outline> tags inside your thinking block. Consider the following:
1. List 3-5 key plot points to cover
2. Briefly describe character development plans for 2-3 main characters
3. Suggest 2-3 vivid setting descriptions
4. Outline 2-3 potential dialogue scenes
5. List 3-5 ways to maintain consistency with previous chapters
6. Identify 3-5 specific style elements to focus on based on the style guidance
7. Note how this chapter advances the overall story premise

After your planning, write the chapter using these guidelines:
1. Begin with a markdown-formatted chapter title (e.g., "# Chapter 1: The Beginning")
2. Use vivid descriptions to bring the scenes to life
3. Include natural, engaging dialogue
4. Maintain consistency with previously established characters, settings, and plot points
5. Strictly adhere to the style guidance provided earlier
6. Ensure the chapter contributes meaningfully to the overall story arc

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

```markdown
# Chapter X: [Chapter Title]

[Your chapter content here, following the guidelines above]
```

Please proceed with your chapter outline and then write the chapter. Your final output should consist only of the markdown-formatted chapter and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the chapter outline.

Now, review the previous context and style guidance for this story:

<previous_context>
{{PREVIOUS_CONTEXT}}
</previous_context>

<style_guidance>
{{STYLE_GUIDANCE}}
</style_guidance>
