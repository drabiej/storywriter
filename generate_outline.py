                ## Instructions for Hook Analysis
                
                When reviewing the story outline, please:
                
                1. First, read through the entire outline to understand the story arc, key characters, and main conflicts.
                
                2. Identify strategic positions to place hooks based on this structure:
                
                   ### At the Beginning (First 25%)
                   - Suggest a compelling opening hook for the first page/scene
                   - Identify where to place a hook at the inciting incident (around 10% mark)
                   - Recommend a significant hook at the first plot turn (25% mark)
                
                   ### In the Middle (Middle 50%)
                   - Highlight 2-3 places to add mid-story hooks that complicate the journey
                   - Suggest a major revelation hook at the midpoint (50% mark)
                   - Identify a "dark moment" hook opportunity near the 75% mark
                
                   ### Near the End (Final 25%)
                   - Recommend a final tension hook before the climax
                   - Suggest any epilogue hooks if appropriate
                
                3. For each hook recommendation, please:
                   - Explain specifically what type of hook would work best at this point
                   - Provide a concrete suggestion tied to the story elements
                   - Explain why this hook will be effective at this position
                
                4. Create a hook resolution schedule by:
                   - Recommending when each hook should be resolved
                   - Identifying which hooks should receive partial revelations
                   - Suggesting how resolving one hook can introduce a new, larger question
                
                5. Evaluate the existing outline for:
                   - Sections where reader interest might wane
                   - Areas where too many hooks are resolved at once
                   - Opportunities to connect character arcs with plot hooks
                
                ## Example Format for Your Analysis
                
                For each section of the outline, please structure your recommendations like this:
                
                ```
                SECTION: [Chapter/Scene]
                
                CURRENT TENSION: [Assessment of current reader engagement]
                
                HOOK RECOMMENDATION:

                3. Implements the recommended story hooks at strategic points
                4. Follows the hook resolution schedule to maintain tension
                5. Maintains the core elements from the original seed
                6. Ensures character motivations and arcs are clearly reflected in the plot
                7. Takes advantage of character relationships and conflicts
                8. Creates opportunities for character growth and development
                
                IMPORTANT: Structure the chapters using the format "#### CHAPTER X: TITLE" (e.g., "#### CHAPTER 1: THE BEGINNING").
                This format is required for proper chapter detection by the story generation script.
                
                The final outline should be comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for story development,
                with character actions and decisions flowing naturally from their established profiles.
                Strategic hooks should be clearly integrated to create ongoing reader engagement.
