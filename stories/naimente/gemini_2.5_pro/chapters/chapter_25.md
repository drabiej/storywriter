# Chapter 25: The Unquenchable

*(Rin POV)*

Dawn broke pale and sickly over the ridgeline. Mist muffled the sounds of the advancing alliance – Kor, Tarthenian, vengeful Arnekol survivors. Rin Tarthan scanned the terrain towards Allemarea, a knot tightening beneath her breastplate. Something felt wrong.

The streams they crossed ran sluggish and grey, edged with withered reeds. Trees drooped, leaves limp, dusted with fine, unnatural ash. The usual dawn chorus was absent, replaced by an expectant silence.

“Commander,” grunted Branoc, her senior clan chief, breath pluming. “The land feels unwell.”

Rin nodded curtly, gaze sweeping the vanguard. “Maintain discipline. Scouts report light resistance. Naimente draws us in.” A tremor ran through the earth. Rin gripped her sword hilt, knuckles white, focusing on the plan—flanks, feints, strike teams—tactics scaled for a kingdom, useless against this gut-deep wrongness. Lyam’s face flashed, unbidden. *Focus.*

She gave the signal. Horns blared, swallowed by the heavy air. Banners lifted – wolf, owl, salvaged scales. The army surged forward, a tide of steel pouring towards the city's corrupted heart. The ground trembled again, harder this time.

*(Naevin POV)*

Darkness pressed close, thick with ancient damp, cold stone, and a metallic tang like ozone. Naevin stumbled forward, hand bracing against the weeping passage wall, Dmar Kasalkath’s lantern casting frantic shadows. Ahead, Tarthenian scouts moved like ghosts. The air felt unnaturally cold, penetrating deep.

They moved deeper into the mountain’s roots, following Naevin’s path gleaned from lore and guesswork, aiming for the Source chamber behind the Great Falls. The roar, which should have been deafening, was a muted, irregular rasp, broken by unsettling pauses.

“Ground tremors again,” Dmar grunted, pausing, hand near his blade. "Feels like the mountain's bones are grinding. This lore of yours better lead somewhere, Naevin."

Naevin’s breath hitched. *The nexus.* Maelor’s warnings, the shrine keeper’s fear... *Gods, the ritual!* “She's destabilizing it,” he whispered, fingers numb.

The passage narrowed into an antechamber of faded glyphs. Colder still, yet a faint, pulsing warmth radiated from the stone ahead. The Falls’ strained rasp was louder, overlaid with a deep grinding from within the rock.

A scout reappeared, pale. “Ahead. Chamber. Strange light… and heat. Like a forge.”

They pressed forward onto a narrow ledge overlooking a vast cavern. Below, bathed in an eerie, shifting violet and green glow, lay the Source chamber. Concentric channels spiraled towards a central altar, now cracked, emitting pulsing heat that distorted the air. Unnatural flames, mirroring Arnekol’s pyre, licked greedily along the dry channels, consuming stone.

And the Great Falls… silenced. Where the torrent should have plunged was a dark, weeping void. The rasp cut off. Utter silence descended, broken only by the hiss of unnatural fire.

Naevin stared, horror stealing his breath. The cold intensified—immense, ancient grief from the dead water. *Daecillaea’s sorrow.* Then, hostile heat pulsed from the fractured altar. *Tarashren’s heart.* Fire against water. Catastrophe. His theories, nightmares made real. “She broke it,” he whispered, voice hollow. “She broke the balance.”

*(Eilene POV)*

Chaos reigned in Allemarea’s outer districts. Eilene felt the ground tremble by the Weavers’ Gate barricade, shouts and clashing steel echoing around her. Naimente’s loyalists fought with grim fanaticism. Arnekol refugees and Tarthenian berserkers pressed the assault, driven by vengeance.

The battle raged, street by street. Then, a sharper tremor. A collective gasp went through both armies as the omnipresent roar of the Great Falls abruptly ceased. Silence crashed down, unnatural, terrifying.

Panic flickered. Soldiers faltered, glancing towards the cliffs. An Allemarean officer screamed, “The Source fails! The Queen’s enemies defile it!” – a rallying cry born of terror.

Before the silence fully registered, a low rumble began, growing swiftly. From the city’s heart, near the palace, a sickly violet light pulsed. An instant later, fire erupted. Not from buildings, but from the dry water channels lacing the city. They vomited flames – violet, green, searing white – roaring upwards, leaping between banks, racing along paths meant for lifeblood.

Chaos absolute. Dry channels turned to roaring pyres. Marble cracked, spitting shards; nearby buildings ignited, proud stonework buckling like wax. The air thickened, searing lungs, choked with smoke and screams.

“Fall back! Re-form ranks!” Eilene roared, grabbing a panicked Kor soldier, shoving him towards cover as flames engulfed a bridge. *Cover—side street. Wounded—drag them clear. Gods, where’s Rin? Naevin?*

Tarthenians recoiled from sudden walls of fire. Naimente’s loyalists broke ranks, stunned, some consumed, others fleeing. The battle became a desperate scramble against the burning city.

Eilene dragged wounded towards a side street, shouting orders, organizing a retreat. Her bandaged hand throbbed, forgotten. She saw the spire of her father’s former trade house collapse into embers. A sharp pang. Then cold focus. Survive this hell. The cost of this war, already unbearable, climbed higher with every scream, every collapsing roof.
