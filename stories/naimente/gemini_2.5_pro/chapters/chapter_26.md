# Chapter 26: Ashanar Rising

Stone groaned. Dust rained, thick and choking, dimming the violet-green light vomiting from the fractured altar. Naimente staggered back, hand pressed to her chest. Baleful heat radiated outwards, the air thick with ozone, sulphur, and the scent of desiccated stone where the otherworldly flames licked. The deafening silence where the Falls’ roar had lived pressed upon her ears.

*It worked.* The thought resonated, cold and clear. The power… immense. Beyond expectation. Obsidian bowls lay overturned, corrupting flames consuming dry channels meant for water, devouring stone itself. The central Ruinekarian altar, source of balance, lay cracked, pulsing hostile heat. Tarashren’s heart, awakened. Daecillaea’s voice… silenced.

A flicker of fear—sharp, cold. Had she miscalculated? But the doubt dissolved beneath Ruinekaria’s echo within her, warmth confirming necessity. The power surged, silencing doubt. No error—this resistance *was* proof of the corruption she fought, demanding this overwhelming purification. *Natre ubel, canil.* After darkness, light. This fire would scour Allemarea clean.

A terrified priest scrambled past, fleeing towards the choked passage. Naimente watched him go, unmoved. Weakness. She turned, surveying the conflagration spreading through the mountain’s heart. This power, volatile but necessary, was hers.

“Highness!” Captain Perrin’s voice, strained but steady, cut through the groaning stone. She emerged from the passage, grimed, flanked by two guards. “The chamber collapses! We must withdraw!”

Naimente nodded, tearing her gaze from the consuming flames. Perrin guided her back through the groaning passage, the mountain’s agony trembling beneath them. Dust thickened. Behind them, a final, grinding crash sealed the Source chamber, entombing the broken altar and its eldritch fire.

They emerged not into quiet corridors, but bedlam. The passage opened onto a gallery overlooking the western districts. Below, Allemarea burned—not with common flame, but the violet-green contagion from the Source, racing along dry channels she'd restored. Arteries vomited fire. Marble cracked, spitting embers; stone turned brittle. Towers leaned, crowned in flame. The air pulsed, searingly dry, thick with smoke and distant screams… irrelevant.

Perrin shielded Naimente as nearby roofing collapsed, cascading sparks. “The palace holds, Highness, but the fire spreads through the channels… faster than anticipated.”

Naimente watched, detached. Children ran, faces streaked with terror. Figures writhed in sudden bursts of emerald flame. Buildings imploded, consumed from within. She saw not horror, but a vast, terrible surgery. Necessary. The rot ran deep. The poison required this cure. A phantom itch touched her palms—cleansing.

“Move,” she commanded, voice flat. “The throne room.”

Their path was a nightmare. Tapestries smouldered, scorched by flames licking from ornate conduits. Shattered statues lay like fallen idols. Smoke coiled thick with the stench of burning luxury and fear. Wounded guards stumbled past, soot-masked, eyes reflecting the fires. Perrin dispatched two guards to secure the Royal Wing, pressing on with Naimente and the remaining soldier, navigating fallen beams and spreading pools of violet fire devouring gilded furniture.

Near the library, a flare erupted from a floor channel. The last guard screamed, collapsing into incandescent ash. Perrin flinched, pulling Naimente back, shielding her, face tight. “Highness, this way!”

They burst through shattered doors into the ravaged Great Hall. Flames roared up floor channels, casting grotesque shadows on soot-stained walls. The high ceiling groaned. Naimente barely registered it, gaze fixed on the dais. The twin thrones—Aethen’s eternally empty. *He lacked the will,* she thought dispassionately. *Weakness that would have doomed us all.* The thrones stood untouched, bathed in infernal light.

“Secure the entrance, Captain,” Naimente ordered, voice distant. “Permit no one entry.”

Perrin hesitated, glancing back at the inferno. “Highness…”

“Go.” Naimente turned towards the dais, drawn by an undeniable pull. Perrin obeyed, steeling herself before plunging back towards the doorway, barking orders into the roaring chaos.

Naimente walked forward alone. Heat seared her skin, smoke stung her eyes. The consuming flames writhed, casting her shadow long and distorted. Ash drifted like black snow. No fear. Only a profound, chilling certainty. Culmination. The final cleansing.

She reached the dais, untouched amidst the pyre, and ascended. Her blue gown stark against the violet-green glare. She turned, surveying the destruction of her capital, the crucible of her reign. She saw not failure, but necessity fulfilled, the *Korle*—truth revealed by fire. The cost, steep. The result, absolute.

The throne felt cool beneath her hand. She sank onto it, ruler amidst the ruin she had wrought. Outside, Allemarea succumbed. Inside, the flames crept closer, licking at the dais steps, heat shimmering, leeching moisture from the air.

Let survivors build from ashes. Let history judge. She had dared what weak kings could not. She closed her eyes, feeling the heat intensify, the light brighten through her lids. The warmth pulsed within her, merging with the encroaching inferno. No regret. Only the consuming fire, welcomed as apotheosis. She sat, serene, as the flames reached the throne, engulfing it, engulfing her, leaving only shimmering heat, rising smoke, and the silence of Ashanar beginning its reign.
