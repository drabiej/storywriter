# Chapter 15: Necessary Wounds

*(Naevin POV)*

Dust, mildewed wool, and fear choked the storeroom air behind the deserted tapestry workshop. A single lamp threw flickering shadows across the faces huddled in its meager light. Naevin Daecilrith gripped a schematic of the palace’s lower levels, graphite smudging his fingers, his neat script devolved into frantic scrawls. Eilene captured. Jarik’s treachery, Perrin’s efficiency—months of fragile observation shattered by torchlight and steel.

“Execution… dawn,” gasped Torvin, the pantry servant, face skeletal with terror. “Conspiracy against the Crown. That’s the word below.”

Dawn. Hours away. Ice-cold panic clawed at Naevin’s throat. Archive dust offered no defense now. *Eilene.* Her peril felt sickeningly different from the cold ache of Elara’s absence, yet horribly connected. Theories crumbled against brutal reality. “Routes?” he demanded, voice tight. “Lockdown? West Gate?”

“Sealed,” Torvin whispered, shaking his head. “Double patrols. Every passage. Perrin anticipated flight. They’re searching rooms.”

Naevin’s mind raced. Diagrams were dead lines. He needed flow, blind spots. “The old aqueduct tunnels? Beneath the West Wing?” He jabbed the schematic. “Jarik mentioned…” *Fool. Trusting Jarik.*

Dmar Kasalkath, scarred solidity near the door, spoke, voice rough gravel. “Suicide, Scholar. If Perrin anticipated flight, she anticipated tunnels. Trapped or watched.” He met Naevin’s frantic gaze, steady despite the grim set of his mouth. “Panic is a luxury.”

Dmar’s pragmatism cut through. Naevin forced a breath, decay thick in his lungs. *Think. Analyze.* Naimente held the keys. What leverage? None. Only desperation.

“The dungeons,” Naevin murmured, tracing another path. “Via the old Cistern Drain? Near the lower guard barracks. Risky. But… less predictable?” He looked at Torvin. “Can it be reached? Undetected?”

Torvin hesitated, eyes darting. “Perhaps. The drain is near the secondary wine cellars… seldom used. The barracks patrol shift changes near second bell… chaotic for a few moments.”

“Second bell,” Naevin repeated, seizing the fragile possibility. A desperate gamble. His hands still trembled, but necessity burned beneath the fear. Theory yielded to action. “Dmar. Rin. We try.”

*(Eilene POV)*

Cold seeped from the dungeon walls, a damp, ancient chill. Water dripped somewhere in the dark, each drop echoing the finality of the slammed, barred door. Her arm throbbed where guards had seized it. Rin’s fury, Dmar’s fall—images burned behind her eyes. Loss. Yet the merchant’s instinct remained: assess. She sat on the stone bench, back straight despite the ache, calculating not escape—that seemed impossible—but leverage, consequence.

Torchlight flickered beyond the bars. Footsteps approached, light, deliberate. A key grated, loud in the quiet. The door swung inward.

Princess Naimente stood framed against the gloom. Alone. Simple dark wool, no regalia, but absolute authority radiated from her. She stepped inside, leaving the door slightly ajar, dismissing unseen guards with a glance.

“Trade Princess Eilene Anaedrui,” Naimente began, voice quiet, reasonable. “An unfortunate necessity.”

Eilene met her gaze. No fear. “Necessity, Highness? Or ambition?”

A flicker—annoyance?—crossed Naimente’s face, then smoothed. “Stability requires difficult choices. Your activities threatened the fragile peace.”

“Peace built on silenced dissent?” Eilene shot back. “Your ‘stability’ feels like a graveyard’s stillness.”

Naimente paced slowly. “You see only disruption. I see the removal of cancers—Iolara’s greed, Caelwin’s weakness, noble privilege. They bled Allemarea dry. My methods are harsh, yes. But water flows to parched fields. Trade thrives. The common folk see hope.”

“Hope shadowed by fear,” Eilene countered. “Bread in one hand, shackles in the other. You speak of healing, yet wield poison and the blade.”

Naimente stopped before her, gaze intense. “Sometimes, a healer must cut away disease. Ruthlessness protects the vulnerable from predators like Vaendae, like those who exploit chaos. You, Trade Princess, with your networks, became a vector for that chaos.” She tilted her head, calculating. “A pity. Your pragmatism could have been useful.”

“My pragmatism sees the true cost of your reign, Highness. It’s ruin.”

Silence settled. Naimente studied her, expression unreadable. Then she moved to the door. “Dawn approaches. Consequences are inevitable.” She paused, hand on the iron. “Yet vigilance falters. Guards grow complacent, locks forgotten…” Her gaze flickered meaningfully to the slightly ajar door, then down the shadowed corridor. “Wasteful carelessness.” She pulled the door almost shut—unbarred, unlatched. A sliver of darkness remained. Her footsteps faded.

Eilene stared. Trap? Test? Mercy as weapon? Negligence? The motive didn't matter. It was a chance. Movement flickered beyond the bars—a signal? Hope, sharp and dangerous, pierced the gloom. She rose silently, taut, moving towards the door, mind already calculating the next move in this deadly game.

*(Rin POV)*

Darkness choked the cistern passage—stagnant water, decay. Rin moved swiftly, blades loose, senses straining. Dmar followed, grim-faced, bandage tight around his ribs, breathing harsh but steps steady. Two shadows detached ahead—Torvin, pale but resolute, and a kitchen maid, loyal because of Rin’s vanished sister, Elara. Their guides.

Naevin’s plan: reach the dungeons via this fetid passage, hit the guard post during shift change, extract Eilene. Audacious. Reckless. Necessary. Rin’s mind, usually clear, felt clouded by cold rage. *Lyam. Perrin’s threats.* This wasn't just strategy; it was defiance. Vengeance deferred.

They emerged into a low corridor near the wine cellars. Faint torchlight ahead. Distantly, muffled by stone, the second bell tolled. *Now.*

Rin signaled. They moved—silent shadows. Two guards, yawning, unprepared. A blur. Steel whispered. The guards slumped. Rin scanned the passage. Clear. Torvin fumbled with keys from a fallen guard, hands shaking. The dungeon corridor beckoned, colder, smelling of despair.

Movement ahead. Eilene, emerging from a cell, pale but resolute. Relief warred with urgency. “Rin!” she breathed.

“Quickly!” Rin hissed, grabbing her arm. “Which way did she go?”

“Naimente…” Eilene stumbled as Rin pulled her onward. “She left the door…”

No time. They plunged back towards the drain passage, footsteps echoing betrayal and fragile hope. Behind them, shouts. An alarm bell clang shattered the quiet.

They raced through darkness, Torvin leading by instinct, the maid whimpering but keeping pace. Pursuit echoed closer—boots pounding, orders shouted. Up stairs, through deserted sculleries smelling of stale grease. The alarm chased them.

Near the West Wing—closer to where Lyam was held, Rin realized—she stopped short. A side passage door stood ajar. Guards rushed *away* from it, drawn by the dungeon alarm. Inside: chaos. Overturned furniture. Struggle. And on the floor—a small, half-carved wooden hawk. Lyam’s style. *Lyam’s.*

A servant cowered nearby, face streaked with grime. She recognized Rin. “Commander Tarthan?” she gasped.

“My cousin? Lyam Tarthan?” Rin gripped her arm, dread twisting low. “What happened?”

The servant pointed, trembling. “Taken. Hours ago. After the merchant. Perrin’s orders… Execution.” She gestured numbly at a dark stain spreading across the floorboards. “There… they didn’t even…” Her voice broke.

The world tilted. Sound rushed away. Rin stared at the stain, the carving. *Lyam. Gone.* Not hostage. Executed. Coldly. As a message. The controlled anger, the strategy—incinerated in white-hot grief and fury. Breath hitched. Her hand tightened on her sword hilt, knuckles white. Naimente. Butcher.

“Rin! We must go! Now!” Dmar’s rough voice cut through. He pulled her arm, face grim, understanding dawning as his gaze followed hers to the stain, the carving. He winced with the movement.

She stumbled back, tearing her gaze away, the hawk carving seared into memory. Grief threatened to swallow her. Warrior instinct, fueled by consuming rage, took hold. Survival first. Revenge later. A promise whispered in the terrible silence of her heart.

They fled, bursting out near the river wall where Naevin waited, face stark white in the pre-dawn gloom. A dilapidated boat bobbed in the mist. Desperate scrambling aboard, shoving off into the current as shouts echoed from the wall, torchlight slicing futilely into the fog.

Allemarea’s towers receded. Fugitives. Wounded. Diminished. Rin huddled in the rocking boat, Eilene shivering beside her, Naevin staring back at the fading city, Dmar grimly poling them downstream, pale with pain. The circle, broken and bleeding, held. Rin clutched the memory of the hawk, the stain. Tears tracked silently down her face, mingling with cold river spray. Her watch was over. The war had begun. Its price, she knew now, was blood.
