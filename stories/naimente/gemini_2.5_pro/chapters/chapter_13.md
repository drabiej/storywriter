# Chapter 13: Walls of Whispers

The throne room felt colder beneath mourning draperies. Grey silks veiled the high windows, where depictions of faded myths barely caught the muted sun. Light filtered through, casting the marble hall in a subdued, underwater glow. Naimente stood beside the twin thrones, a step behind Aethen. King Aethen. The title felt brittle. Grief shadowed his face beneath the circlet of rule; his gaze seemed fixed somewhere beyond the assembled court.

Below, nobles stood in somber hues, expressions masked. Lord Vaendae radiated resentment near a pillar. Lady Maeve Thurinal watched Aethen with troubled sympathy. Further back, the watchers: Naevin the scholar, Rin the warrior, Eilene the merchant. Foreigners, lingering shadows, observing her consolidation.

Minister Therin unrolled a parchment, his voice echoing slightly. Aethen stirred, his hand trembling on the throne’s armrest. He cleared his throat, his voice softer than his father’s, yet carrying a new, uncertain authority.

“We decree,” Aethen began, reading words Naimente had crafted—words balancing solace with steel, “that the reforms ensuring equitable water distribution and fair trade shall continue. Allemarea’s strength lies in the well-being of all its people.” He paused, glancing towards Naimente. She offered a subtle nod. Doubt flickered in his eyes before he forced himself back to the scroll.

“Furthermore,” he continued, voice firmer, adopting the cadence they’d rehearsed, “to ensure security, resources must reinforce key infrastructure. Northern roads require repair. Border garrisons must be strengthened.” His gaze swept the hall. “These are defensive measures, necessary precautions.”

*Defensive. Necessary.* The words settled. A murmur rippled through the court—acceptance, veiled dissent. Vaendae’s jaw tightened. He understood. A cold satisfaction prickled within Naimente. Let them murmur. Aethen finished, rolling the parchment with unsteady hands. He sank back, the weight of kingship heavy. Naimente remained standing, her stillness a silent testament to where power now resided.

Later, the narrow passage behind the Royal Archives tapestry felt colder still. Dust motes danced in the light from a hidden sconce, catching the weary lines around Captain Perrin’s eyes. Her face remained a disciplined mask. She delivered reports with unnerving speed, her voice a low murmur. She offered a slim folio.

“The reports, Your Highness.”

Naimente took it, the leather cool. She scanned the precise script: Vaendae’s meetings. Thurinal’s concerns spreading. Servants’ whispers about the King, quickly silenced. And the foreigners.

“Naevin met his informant – the gardener, Kevan – near the kitchens,” Perrin reported. “Our listener confirms details passed: grain requisitions, guard deployments.”

Naimente’s grip tightened. Kevan. Lyra’s father. A man she had helped, now feeding information. Disappointment curdled. Sentiment was a liability. “The coded messages?”

“Intercepted courier from the Arnekol delegation. Contents relayed via Eilene’s network. Analysis ongoing. Preliminary decryption suggests queries matching Naevin’s archive searches: Third Reign precedents, resource control.” Perrin met Naimente’s gaze. “They are pooling intelligence, Highness. Scholar, warrior, merchant. A unit.”

A cold dread coiled in Naimente’s stomach. She crushed it down, replaced by an icy pulse—familiar, dangerous. They suspected. Probed. A threat coalescing in the shadows. “Their access must be curtailed. Double the watch. Restrict archive access—cite mourning protocols. Internal contacts…” Her voice dropped. “Handle them. Quietly. Start with the cook who grumbled. An example is needed. Fear deters when loyalty wavers. *Never helpless again.*”

Perrin nodded, unflinching. “It will be done.”

“And Kevan?” Naimente hesitated, Lyra’s face a fleeting phantom—small, pale, unsaved. Ruthlessness settled, cold and final. “Withdraw his privileges. Assign him duties far from sensitive areas. Ensure he understands the cost of misplaced trust.”

“Understood, Highness.”

“Leave me.”

Perrin bowed, melting into the gloom. Naimente stood alone, silence pressing. Necessary wounds. Necessary walls. The palace itself felt different—a fortress, its whispers hostile, its shadows concealing threats. Every corner watched, every word weighed. Surrounded, yet utterly alone. Sacrifices for the greater good. The phrase tasted like ash, thin as the gruel that starved her parents, brittle as failed hope. Still, she clung to it—her only shield.

Moonlight spilled into the private garden, silvering the *aivle*-blossoms. The water in the channel murmured, a liquid whisper that felt watchful tonight, accusatory. Aethen sat on their bench, shoulders slumped, tracing patterns on the stone. Untouched paper cranes and river-barges, symbols of a shared dream, gathered dust nearby.

Naimente sat beside him. Taking his hand felt deliberate. His skin was cool.

“You seem distant,” she said softly.

He sighed, turning, his hazel eyes clouded. “The decrees… the guards… Perrin’s reach. Cook Rennik taken, others dismissed. Kevan… reassigned.” His voice held bewildered pain. “Whispers turn to fear. Is this… necessary?”

The hesitant question struck a discordant note. His naivety felt like an obstacle. “Aethen,” she began, voice gentle, “stability requires vigilance. Especially now. Those dismissed sowed dissent. Vaendae grasps at any weakness. We cannot allow division.”

“But Rennik complained about flour! Kevan helped us!” Aethen pleaded. “It feels… harsh. Cold. Not the hope we promised.”

“Hope needs a strong foundation,” Naimente countered, withdrawing her hand slightly. “Sentiment cannot govern. Sacrifices are needed to protect the whole. To protect the reforms. To protect *us*.” She met his gaze, willing him to understand the threats she saw so clearly. “Your father hesitated. He would have let Vaendae dismantle everything. We cannot afford weakness.”

Aethen flinched. He looked away. “Weakness? Or caution? My mother… saw threats everywhere. It twisted her.” He looked back, dawning horror in his eyes, a chill worse than any enemy report. “Are we becoming what we fought against?”

The comparison struck like ice. *He doesn't understand.* The accusation hung between them, sharp as fractured glass. He saw only methods, not the vision. He clung to ideals; she wrestled brutal realities. Affection warred with impatience. He was her husband, her king, the gentle heart she sought to protect. But his softness, his qualms… a liability. A gulf opened between them, silent and deep.

“I do what is necessary, Aethen,” she stated, words flat, final. “For Allemarea. You must trust me.” She rose, leaving him beside the whispering water, the scent of blossoms suddenly cloying. Another walled enclosure. *Trust me.* Looking back at his stricken face, she knew trust was already fractured. And she could not allow his doubt to impede her path. A cold fire burned away the last vestiges of hesitation.
