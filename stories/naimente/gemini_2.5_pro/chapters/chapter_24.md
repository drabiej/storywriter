# Chapter 24: Hallowed Ground

The air lay thick, tasting of smoke, blood, and the damp earth churned by retreat. Naimente stood upon a low rise overlooking the field hospital, a canvas island amidst the debris of the feigned skirmish. Below, wounded soldiers groaned. Nearer the command tent where Aethen’s body lay – *King* Aethen, the word a discarded husk – orchestrated lamentations rose.

She watched Captain Perrin move among the honour guard, ensuring the narrative took root: *A hero’s charge… Cut down protecting his men…* Genuine grief radiated from the witnesses, fertile ground for Perrin's seeds. Naimente noted their anguish, a flicker in her gaze before shifting back to Perrin. Aethen’s last service. His gentle heart, a liability in life, now a weapon.

A lieutenant approached, helmet tucked under his arm, face grimed, sorrow etched deep. “Highness… the men speak of vengeance. For the King.”

Naimente turned slowly, composing her features into shared grief, a controlled tremor entering her voice. “His sacrifice demands no less.” She gazed towards the distant peaks where the alliance gathered. “They sought to shatter our spirit. Instead, they turned it to stone.” Her gaze swept the wounded, the grieving. “Let King Aethen’s pyre fuel our vengeance. Allemarea remembers.” The words settled, calculated. The lieutenant bowed, visibly moved, returning to spread the fire.

She turned away, the performance complete, the cold air a welcome shock. Aethen. Severed. Weakness purged. Only the path remained. *Her* path. For Allemarea’s purification. The warmth pulsed within her, steady. *Korle.* Truth.

Later, within the palace walls thick with incense, Naimente summoned Torwen the Rainkeeper. He arrived hesitant, deeper lines etched on his face, his deference tinged with fear. He bowed stiffly in the shadowed scriptorium where Naimente reviewed ancient water diagrams—copies painstakingly acquired.

“Rainkeeper,” Naimente began, her voice quiet, absolute. “Allemarea’s lifeblood weakens. The Great Falls diminish.”

Torwen nodded warily. “Aye, Highness. The flow lessens. The cycle shifts.”

“The cycle must be *corrected*,” Naimente stated, tapping a diagram depicting the Falls’ hidden source chambers, marked with Ruinekarian glyphs she had spent weeks deciphering – or perhaps, misinterpreting. “Ancient rites exist. Rites of purification. To cleanse the Source.”

Torwen shifted, unease plain. “Highness…” His hands trembled slightly near the diagrams. “Those rites are fragments. Dangerous whispers. They risk *breaking* the flow, not cleansing. The last Rainkeeper who delved too deep…” He swallowed, looking away.

A faint echo – Aedil’s warning – surfaced, submerged instantly. “Fear blinds you, Torwen,” Naimente dismissed coolly. “I have studied the deep truths others shy from.” Her violet eyes met his, unwavering. “Corruption runs deep. In the court, the land, perhaps the water itself. It must be purged. *Tarash*. Fire cleanses. Water renews. The ritual balances them. It requires your knowledge of the deep ways.”

“But Highness, the risk…”

“Is necessary,” Naimente cut him off. “Allemarea requires this. *I* require it.” Her voice dropped, edged with steel. “Gather what is needed. Loyal priests. The elements detailed here.” She pushed a list across the table. “Tonight. Under cover of mourning.”

Torwen stared at the list, then at her, trapped. He bowed his head, defeated. “As you command, Highness.” He retreated, leaving Naimente with the diagrams, the weight of certainty settling like a mantle. She traced the glyphs, lips moving silently. *Daecil ea Tarash. Natre ubel, canil.* Water and Fire. After darkness, light.

The journey to the Source was secret, through passages beneath the palace, into the mountain’s cold heart. The air grew heavy, resonant with the Falls’ diminishing roar, a vibration felt in bone. Water wept from ancient stone, tracing dark paths down slick walls.

At last, the chamber: vast, echoing, carved from living rock behind the main cascade. Its sole ingress, a narrow passage choked with decayed mechanisms, Torwen cleared with visible reluctance. Here, the air tasted of ozone, deep earth, and immense, dormant power. Concentric channels radiated like stone veins from a great central altar. Across the floor spiralled Ruinekarian script, deeper, more complex, converging upon the altar. Muffled by rock, the Falls’ roar persisted—a strained, uneven pressure.

Naimente moved to the altar, priests trailing hesitantly. Torwen lingered near the entrance, grim-faced. She placed the artifacts: obsidian bowls, dried *ivera* root, a dark Ruinekarian stone pulsing faintly with internal heat – from the forest shrine. Her fingers brushed the stone, a brief, unfamiliar coldness beneath the warmth, instantly dismissed.

She began the chant, Ruinekarian phrases alien yet familiar. Words of power, cleansing, balance – as she understood them. *Abuson Daecil. Amavesh Tarash.* Bestow Water. Expand Fire. Scarred fingers traced patterns in the air, mirroring the floor’s spirals.

The chamber held its breath. The Falls’ roar faltered, the vibration lessening. The air grew colder; the dark stone pulsed warmer, emanating palpable heat. A priest gasped, stumbling back. Torwen muttered ancient wards.

Naimente felt only exhilaration. Certainty. This was right. Necessary. She poured ritual oils into the bowls, igniting them. Violet, green flames burned unnaturally bright, casting writhing shadows over the script. *The purifying flame.*

She poured Source water over the pulsing stone. It hissed, steam rising thick, acrid, smelling of sulphur, of burning. The stone glowed brighter, hotter. *Balance.*

She spoke the final phrase, a word of binding, of command. *Korle. Rin.* Truth. First. She slammed her hands onto the altar.

The floor shuddered – a deep, grinding *shift*. The altar stone flared blindingly, then cracked, a jagged line splitting its surface. The flames leaped, intensifying, spilling, impossibly consuming damp stone, racing along the channels.

The roar of the Falls ceased. Cut off. Absolute, terrifying silence descended, broken only by the hiss of flames devouring stone and the widening crack.

Then, a deep groan echoed from the mountain’s heart. The ground bucked violently. Dust rained. Priests screamed. Torwen stared, face bleached white, horror dawning too late.

Naimente stood frozen, hands on the fractured altar, bathed in eerie light. Shock warred with fierce conviction. The power unleashed was immense, terrifying, far beyond calculation. But as the chamber groaned, as unnatural flames spread, a part of her saw not error, but culmination. Purification. Violent. Absolute. A necessary wound, inflicted by her hand. *Korle.* The chilling certainty remained, even as Allemarea began to die.
