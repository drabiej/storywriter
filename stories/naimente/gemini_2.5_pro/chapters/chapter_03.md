# Chapter 3: Whispers in the Water

*(Naimente POV)*

Morning light filtered through thin alabaster, slanting across the royal bedchamber. Dust motes danced above polished *iver*wood. Light glinted off the narrow water channel tracing the room's perimeter, its surface barely trembling with Naimente’s breath. Silks pooled around her, an unimaginable softness against skin still remembering roughspun wool. Aethen slept beside her, his face serene, an artist’s callused hand near hers – a familiar anchor.

Yesterday’s weight—the ceremony, the eyes—pressed down, mixing with strange scents of oils and damp stone. Barefoot, she crossed cool marble inlaid with river patterns towards the water channel murmuring its constant song. *Daecil*. Water. Lifeblood, hoarded here while villages upstream withered.

She paused before a tall, silver-framed looking-glass. The reflected woman wore a borrowed shape: dark hair loose, violet eyes stark against olive skin, clad in sea-foam silk. The healer felt submerged beneath the finery. Only the faint web of scars on her hands remained hers, etched by lye and the desperate grip of the dying. She clenched them, Lyra’s small, fading hand a sharp contrast to this luxury.

“Naimente?” Aethen sat up, pushing back light brown hair. Hazel eyes, softened with the concern that had first drawn her, found hers in the glass.

She turned, forcing a smile. “Forgive me.”

“Too grand?” he asked, understanding dawning. “Too quiet?” He joined her by the channel, his simple linen more natural than yesterday’s robes. “We face it together. You are not alone.”

His sincerity eased the knot in her chest. “I know.” She traced the channel’s rim. “It’s merely… stark. All this”—a vague gesture—“while northern ditches run dry. We spoke of changing that. Ensuring the waters nourish all Allemarea.”

“And we shall,” he affirmed, his hand covering hers, his belief a tangible warmth. “My father listens, though tradition binds him. My mother…” He hesitated, a muscle flickering in his jaw. “She values lineage. But she will see your worth. In time.”

Naimente met his earnest gaze, resolve flaring. Aethen’s gentleness was a gift, but her own hardship-honed will must carve their path. “Time is a luxury some cannot afford, Aethen. We must begin.”

He nodded, squeezing her hand. “Today, the presentations. Let them see your strength. Mine is with you.”

His faith steadied her. Yet, gazing into the clear water, she saw not hope, but shadowed village faces, loss, and the cold necessity ahead. The whispers had begun. Now came the confrontation.

*(Multiple POVs)*

The diplomatic briefing room felt airless. Heavy tapestries absorbed the light. Minister Therin Vaenlir, stooped and meticulous, spoke with self-important deliberation, his voice thin as old parchment.

“...Thus,” Therin concluded, liver-spotted hands fluttering, “His Majesty deems it prudent for esteemed representatives of Kor, Tarthenia, and Arnekol to extend their stay. Post-nuptial consultations regarding tariffs, borders, and security are… necessitated. Suitable quarters shall be maintained.”

*(Naevin POV)*
*Extended stay.* Naevin exchanged a look with Dmar. Opportunity, but Allemarea held guests firmly. He felt the net closing. His gaze drifted to the sharp-featured Tarthenian, Rin Tarthan, her hand near concealed hilts – a warrior assessing confinement. Across the table, the Arnekol merchant, Eilene Anaedrui, noted calculations on a wax tablet, purely transactional. Interesting contrasts, their reasons differing, now bound by delay. Therin’s slight vocal tremor – age, or practiced obfuscation? The same evasiveness that met his inquiries about Elara these five years? Proximity might offer leverage.

*(Rin POV)*
*Extended stay.* Muscles tight. Lyam remained a gilded captive. Did this commoner princess signal exploitable instability, or strengthen the Crown, diminishing Lyam’s value? Galling uncertainty. She studied the Kor scholar, Naevin – quietly intense behind spectacles. The Arnekol merchant, Eilene – pragmatic competence. Reluctant companions. Therin droned on, oblivious to undercurrents. Weakness. Like the King she’d observed. A court adrift. What currents would this new princess unleash?

*(Eilene POV)*
*Extended stay.* Eilene mentally tallied the costs: disrupted schedules, delayed caravans, renegotiated contracts. Yet… also time. Time to observe the new power dynamic, assess Naimente’s influence, perhaps leverage better terms. She noted the Tarthenian’s tension, the Kor scholar’s scrutiny. They saw instability. Alliances, even temporary ones, were assets. Catching Naevin’s eye – a flicker of mutual assessment. “Minister Therin,” Eilene interjected smoothly, “Arnekol appreciates Allemarea’s hospitality. Perhaps while consultations proceed, interim arrangements could ensure essential goods continue to flow? Stability benefits all.” Therin blinked. Eilene pressed the advantage, outlining practicalities. Keep the channels open.

*(Naimente POV)*

The Great Hall felt different today. Less expectant, more openly assessing. Naimente stood beside Aethen near the twin thrones, the court’s gaze a physical pressure. Nobles arrayed themselves in calculated tiers, silks rustling. King Caelwin slumped on his throne, ornate robes swallowing his frail form, gaze weary beneath a groomed beard. Beside him, Queen Iolara sat regal and still, silver-streaked hair coiled, ancient sapphires gleaming at her throat – stones whispered to connect the wearer to Daecillaea, the Blue Fury of water. As Naimente looked at them, a faint coolness brushed her senses, like water deeper and colder than expected. The Queen’s olive face was a mask, but her eyes, flicking towards Naimente, held a cold light.

Minister Therin began, voice quavering slightly. “…Princess Naimente Aeldae, wife to our beloved Prince Aethen, now gracing our court.” Polite, thin murmurs followed.

Then Queen Iolara spoke, her voice smooth river stone with a cutting edge. “Welcome, child.” The word hung, patronizing. “We trust the palace proves… adequate? Such a change from the north. One hopes the transition is not too jarring? The capital's demands differ greatly from… quieter environs.”

A ripple of quickly suppressed amusement. Aethen stiffened. Naimente kept her chin high, meeting the Queen’s gaze. “Your Majesty is gracious. The palace is vast. Yet the needs of people, north or south, are much the same: security, sustenance, justice. Needs this city, with its wondrous water channels, is uniquely placed to provide.” Her gaze swept the hall, noting a darkened channel, a cracked mosaic. “If tended properly.”

Iolara’s smile thinned. “Ah, such… *practical* concerns. Aethen always did have a heart for the common folk. Commendable, though governance requires a perspective grounded in lineage, wouldn’t you agree, Your Majesty?” She turned to the King.

Caelwin started. “Hmm? Ah, yes, tradition… vital. But… new perspectives… merit. My dear.” His gaze slid away, meeting neither his wife’s challenge nor Naimente’s steadiness. A vacuum yawned where the kingdom’s heart should be.

Iolara turned back, voice lower but audible nearby. “A healer’s touch is for the sickbed, child. Ruling requires different arts, learned over generations. Allemarea’s roots run deep, into waters you cannot comprehend. Tread carefully.” The threat, wrapped in silk. *Outsider.*

Cold knotted in Naimente's stomach, but the faint warmth felt before the Ruinekarian shrine answered the Queen's chill. She held Iolara’s gaze, voice low but clear. “I thank Your Majesty. I understand roots. Even the grandest tree fails if its roots starve while upper branches hoard the sun.” She touched her scarred hand. “I am here to serve Allemarea, and my husband. And I learn quickly.” The warmth settled within her, hardening like embers.

Tense silence fell. Iolara’s eyes narrowed before her mask slid back. A dismissive nod. She turned away, the insignificant northern girl seemingly put in her place.

But Naimente knew. This was only the beginning. The Queen's challenge laid bare, the court's resistance embodied. Aethen took her hand, his grip tight – silent support. But seeing Iolara’s rigid back, the King’s weary resignation, the calculating eyes around her – the weight settled, cold and hard. The whispers in the water were turning into a roar. To survive here, let alone heal this kingdom, would require a hardness she was only beginning to find.
