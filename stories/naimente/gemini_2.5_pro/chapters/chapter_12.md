# Chapter 12: Three-Fold Witness

*(Naevin POV)*

The back room of the Spice Merchant’s Guild office felt cramped, the air thick with aged cinnamon, damp stone, and the residue of secrets. Lamplight threw oily shadows across the four figures gathered around a scarred crate. Outside, Allemarea performed its mourning for the King while whispers questioned Prince Aethen’s swift coronation—a ceremony dominated by Princess Naimente’s sentinel presence.

Naevin Daecilrith adjusted his spectacles against the pressing silence. Opposite, Rin Tarthan, the Tarthenian envoy, sat rigid, tension coiled beneath her stillness. Beside her, Eilene Anaedrui, Arnekol’s Trade Princess, had abandoned her abacus, her sharp eyes missing nothing. Near the door, Dmar Kasalkath stood sentinel, gaze fixed on the alley beyond the grimy window. Suspicion had inexorably drawn them here.

“The King is dead,” Naevin stated, the words flat. “Officially, heart failure. Natural causes.” He let the lie settle. “Yet his physician noted renewed vigour days ago. And the King himself spoke, hours before his death, of… limiting the Princess’s authority.”

Eilene’s lips thinned. “Convenient. The final check on her power removed. A coronation executed with suspicious speed. Aethen grieves; Naimente rules.” She tapped the crate. “The ledger reads: opportunity seized.”

Rin Tarthan’s green eyes narrowed. “The King voiced opposition. Then died. The pattern holds.” Her low voice resonated with fury. “First the Queen, whose ‘fall’ removed her chief rival. Now the King, who sought to curb her. Both deaths smoothed her path.”

“And history echoes,” Naevin continued, drawing out notes, his ink-stained fingers trembling slightly. “The Third Reign Decline: a failing king, a queen’s controversial death, a power rising amidst unrest, vital records vanishing.” He met their gazes. “The *Water Treaties Compendium*—detailing precedents against Lord Vaendae’s claims, which the King seemed ready to uphold—is missing from the Royal Archives. As are records on past crises: border defences, famine relief. My sister Elara researched that *Compendium* before she vanished.” The connection twisted academic curiosity into cold certainty.

“She removes obstacles,” Rin stated, conviction hardening her tone. “Methodically.”

“Or poisons them,” Eilene added dryly. “A healer knows remedies. And their opposites.”

Silence fell, heavy and absolute. The truth, circled individually, now solidified in the shared gloom: Naimente Kamame, healer and reformer, was a killer cloaked in statecraft.

Naevin breathed deeply, the scholar yielding to grim reality. “We cannot stand by. Her ambition reaches beyond Allemarea.” He addressed each in turn. “Kor values reason, Tarthenia honour, Arnekol stability. She threatens all.”

“My cousin Lyam remains her hostage,” Rin said tightly. “Tarthenia cannot act openly. But act we must.”

Eilene nodded, her mind calculating. “Direct confrontation is suicide. She holds the capital, the army, the narrative. We need leverage. Information. Allies within.”

“Then we forge our own path,” Naevin declared, necessity settling upon him like an unfamiliar mantle. “A secret alliance. We share intelligence, coordinate, seek weaknesses. Eilene, your networks are vital. Rin, your insight and Tarthenian connections. Dmar… your blade offers protection we cannot lack.”

He met their eyes. “Do we agree? To stand together, in shadow?”

Rin gave a sharp nod. “For Tarthenia. For Lyam.”

Eilene’s gaze was steady. “For Arnekol. And the truth.”

Dmar shifted, a silent affirmation.

A knot tightened in Naevin’s stomach. Conspiracy was a path paved with peril. Yet, seeing their faces united by grim purpose, hope flickered. “Then it begins,” he said quietly. “May reason guide us.”

*(Eilene POV)*

The Midday Market pulsed with a fragile vibrancy under the summer sun. Stalls overflowed with produce, northern wools, and crafts – fruits of an economic recovery ironically fostered by the regime Eilene now plotted against. The dissonance echoed in her internal ledger as she moved through the throng, acknowledging merchants’ greetings.

Near the Coopers’ stalls, she paused, examining barrels. A man hauling sacks brushed past, murmuring, “Southern vintage delayed. Quality uncertain.” Code confirmed: her query about suspicious iron orders placed by Allemarean agents had reached her factor. *Uncertain* meant investigation was warranted.

Purchasing a vinegar cask, Eilene slipped an overfilled coin pouch to the cooper. Nestled amongst silver: a rolled message on onion-skin paper detailing Naevin’s findings on the missing records, requesting cross-referencing with Arnekol archives for coinciding resource movements during the Third Reign. “For the Vintner’s Guild factor, Maris,” she instructed quietly. “Assessment.” The indebted cooper nodded. Diversify assets, diversify couriers.

Later, in a Weaver’s Guild back office, Eilene spoke softly to Master Fenn, whose family had suffered under old monopolies. “We seek partners… for a venture requiring discretion. Assessing stability. Reliable information is key.”

Fenn listened, face grim. “Her Highness brings order, Trade Princess. But the guards watch too closely. New chains chafe differently.”

Gratitude laced with fear. Potential allies existed, but Naimente’s surveillance was efficient. “Reliability commands a premium,” Eilene stated. “Discretion above all. Consider who among your trusted network perceives similar market fluctuations.”

Fenn nodded slowly. “I will inquire. Cautiously.”

Eilene rose. Each contact, each message, was a calculated risk against Naimente’s tightening control. Building this network wasn't just prudent risk management; it was groundwork for survival, an investment against a future threatening bankruptcy—or worse.

*(Rin POV)*

The palace visitation chamber felt cold despite the lemon oil scent and barred sunlight striping the marble floor. Lyam was absent. Captain Perrin faced Rin, flanked by two impassive Palace Guards.

“Commander Tarthan,” Perrin began, voice flat. “King Aethen relies heavily on Princess Naimente’s judgment regarding state security. Regrettably, visitation privileges for your cousin, Lyam Tarthan, are temporarily suspended.”

A chill seized Rin. “Suspended? On what grounds?”

“Ongoing security assessments,” Perrin replied smoothly. “Given transition sensitivities, all high-value diplomatic residents are subject to revised protocols. For their protection.”

*Protection*. The word felt like a veiled threat. “My cousin is Tarthenia’s blood, Captain. Not merely a ‘diplomatic resident’.”

“His status is noted. The decision stands. You will be informed when protocols permit contact.” Perrin’s cold eyes offered no compromise.

Fury surged, threatening Rin’s composure. Her hand ached for her sword. *Suspended*. Cut off. Interrogated? Threatened? Moved? Naimente’s manoeuvre – isolating Lyam, tightening the leash.

Rin forced a curt nod, refusing to show weakness. “Inform Her Highness that Tarthenia notes this… revision… with deep concern.” She turned, strides measured, refusing Perrin the satisfaction of seeing her turmoil.

Back in her quarters, the mask crumbled. She paced, the rich furnishings a mockery. Lyam’s terrified eyes, his hand crushing the wolf carving weeks ago—the memory clawed at her. *Patience*, she had counselled him. Now patience felt like poison. Her fingers found the half-finished hawk carving she kept hidden. Picking up her knife, the familiar weight offered scant comfort.

The alliance—Naevin’s plans, Eilene’s networks—felt agonizingly slow. Lyam was vulnerable *now*. Cold strategy warred with the primal urge to strike. Naimente understood leverage, fear. Rin’s hand tightened on the knife, knuckles white. Perhaps it was time Naimente learned Tarthenia understood consequences. The strategist wrestled with the fury of kin; one wrong move meant ruin, yet waiting felt unbearable.
