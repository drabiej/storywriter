# Chapter 19: Salt and Ash

The ascent from the wine merchant’s cellar was a climb through catastrophe. First, the press of bodies in darkness, air thick with fear and dust. Then, a scramble over fallen beams, stone steps slick with something foul. Finally, pushing aside rubble, Eilene Anaedrui emerged into the remains of Arnekol.

She choked. Air caught, thick with smoke and a terrible stillness where vibrancy should have thrived. Dawn painted the sky bruised plum and angry orange, smeared by pillars of greasy black smoke rising from the city’s corpse. The air tasted of burnt stone, cooked metal, and something sweeter, sickening – scorched flesh. It fouled the back of her throat.

Where the Plaza of Balanced Scales had pulsed with commerce lay a cratered wasteland. Gutted. The Grand Exchange stood skeletal against the infernal sky, its proud brass scales melted into grotesque golden tears. Trading houses were jagged teeth of charred timber and fractured marble, bleeding smoke. The canals, once arteries carrying goods, choked on debris. Some sections steamed with an oily residue left by flames that had burned violet and bilious green – colours no earthly fire possessed.

Eilene stumbled, clutching the heavy merchant’s abacus, its smooth beads an absurd anchor. Her left hand throbbed – a searing kiss from collapsing stone. Skin blistered, an angry bloom. A scar, she thought numbly. A ledger entry for this day. Shock was a cold shroud, layering over bone-deep exhaustion, over bruises from the escape hours before.

Distant cries threaded the air, thin against the crackle of fires and the sudden collapse of weakened structures. Closer, silence reigned. Where were the crowds, the haggling, the click of beads tallying prosperity? Gone. Incinerated.

Grief threatened to buckle her knees. Her father’s guildhall – a pyre. The quay where her first cargoes arrived – wreckage. Generations of success – turned to ash. Naimente’s “purifying flame.” A tremor ran through her, cold beneath the heat. But Arnekol pragmatism surged. Grief was a luxury. Survival was currency.

She forced movement, picking through debris, eyes scanning. Survivors. Assets. That was the calculation now. A low moan drew her towards a crushed spice stall. A man lay pinned, face grey. Leg crushed, breathing shallow. Beyond her aid alone. “Hold fast,” she murmured, the words hollow. “Help comes.” Liar.

She pushed onward. A child sobbed beside its still mother. A merchant wandered, blank-faced, clutching a single ledger. Eilene grabbed his arm. “Fenrir! Look at me.”

Recognition flickered. “Eilene… Anaedrui… Gone.”

“The buildings. Not the people.” She pulled him. “West. Old Weavers’ cellar. Move!”

Hesitantly, others emerged. Stumbling from basements, crawling from rubble, faces smeared soot, eyes wide. The wounded leaned on the unwounded. Enemies ignored each other. She saw Trade Princess Selene, silks torn, face grimy, organizing a small group near the Silversmiths’ Hall ruins. Their eyes met – shared shock, then cold acknowledgment. Selene gave a curt nod, turning back to her cluster. Divisions remained, even here.

Eilene led her growing band through nightmarish streets. “Water! Bandages! Find food!” Her voice, usually measured, turned clipped, authoritative. Order imposed on chaos, bead by bead. Someone balked near a precarious archway. "Blocked! We can't-"
"This way," Eilene cut in, pointing firmly past it. "Now." They followed.

The Old Weavers’ Guild cellar was deep, intact, thick with the smell of damp earth and panic. Lanterns cast flickering light on dozens huddled within. Spectral faces. Terror. Loss. The wounded lay on scorched carpets, their moans a low thrum.

Eilene found a corner, setting her abacus on an overturned crate. She surveyed the scene, the merchant’s eye assessing inventory. Not goods. Lives. She moved among them, voice calm, hand throbbing. Water first. Bandages – torn silks, linens. Food – pitifully little. She knelt by a young woman tending a child with severe burns, the sickly sweet smell sharp. The child’s whimpers were weak. Eilene offered her waterskin. “Slowly.”

Then she returned to her abacus.
Click. Click. Click. The familiar sound, sharp in the quiet. Not profit margins. She tallied the living. Marked the gravely wounded – *liabilities*, her mind whispered coldly, instantly shamed. Naevin? Rin? Dmar? Had they escaped? Unknown variables. Noted the able-bodied. Quantified water skins, salvaged grain, vials of burn salve.

A former guard captain, arm useless, approached. “Princess Anaedrui. What… now?”

Eilene looked up. “Now,” she said, voice flat, “we assess losses. Determine assets. Formulate an escape.”

“Escape?” A burly merchant scoffed weakly. “Where? Allemarea holds the valley.”

“Not the mountains.” Eilene pointed westward on an imagined map. “The Serpent’s Spine pass. Difficult. Defensible. It leads towards Tarthenia.”

Murmurs rippled. Tarthenia. Warriors, mountains. Alien to Arnekol’s order.

“Suicide,” the merchant argued. “Weeks through harsh land. Pursuit…”

“Staying is suicide,” Eilene countered sharply. “Naimente will hunt survivors. Finish what the fire started.” She met fearful eyes. “Arnekol was its people. Its resilience. Its knowledge.” Her gaze hardened. “We carry Arnekol within us. We survive. We endure. We reach Tarthenia. Then… we reckon the accounts.” Accounts that might have been simpler, she thought with a flash of bitterness, if the gamble hadn't failed so catastrophically.

Silence, broken by dripping water and the soft click of Eilene’s abacus finalizing the tally of souls. Her authority settled, cold but absolute. Not hope; survival. A harsh commodity.

Hours later, under smoke-dimmed twilight, a ragged column emerged. Perhaps two hundred souls, grim-faced, carrying wounded and salvaged bundles. Eilene walked near the head, burned hand wrapped crudely, abacus at her belt. Selene led another group slightly behind, wary but following. Necessity’s fragile concord.

They moved through the skeletal city, past ghosts of prosperity. Heat still shimmered. The stench of destruction clung like grave-dirt. Ahead, the jagged silhouette of the Serpent’s Spine loomed, black against the bruised sky – a hostile refuge.

Eilene glanced back once at the pyre of Arnekol, smoke rising like accusations. Grief clawed. Ruthlessly suppressed. Calculations clicked – distance, rations, pursuit. The merchant was dead. The survivor, the rebuilder, the leader forged in ash, took another step towards the peaks, the weight of her people a heavier burden than any ledger.

The exodus had begun. Salt and ash – Arnekol’s new foundations.
