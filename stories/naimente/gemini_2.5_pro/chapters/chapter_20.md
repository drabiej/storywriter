# Chapter 20: Distant Banners

*(Rin POV)*

Stone Hall exhaled the chill of the high peaks, despite the great hearth blazing at its far end. Torchlight guttered, catching threads of timeworn battle banners hanging from dark rafters – histories woven in faded, hard-won silk. Outside the arrow-slits, the Serpent’s Spine clawed at a bruised twilight sky. Greyfang Hold clung to the rock like a hawk’s nest, far from Allemarea’s rot.

Rin Tarthan stood near the dais, spine straight, hands clasped behind her. The familiar weight of her swords beneath her tunic offered little comfort against the burden settling on her. She wore dark leathers, the colours of court replaced by necessity's somber hues.

Before her stood the grim assembly: Tarthenian clan chiefs, faces carved by wind and war, solid as the mountains; Naevin Daecilrith, the Kor scholar, spectacles catching the firelight, his detachment overlaid with gravity; beside him, Dmar Kasalkath stood slightly rigid, favouring one side almost imperceptibly; and Eilene Anaedrui, Trade Princess of Arnekol, her fine silks replaced by borrowed wool, her face pale but composed, one hand bandaged. The merchant's shrewdness had hardened into resolve. Scattered among them were Arnekol's surviving council, bearing the scars of Naimente's flame.

Her father, King Faolan Tarthan, stood upon the dais, silver streaking his dark hair, lines deeper around his eyes, yet his bearing held the strength of the peaks. He raised a hand, quieting the murmur.

“Chieftains. Honoured guests,” his voice resonated, strong as hammered steel. “We gather in shadowed times. Allemarea bleeds under a ruler mistaking cruelty for strength.” His gaze swept the hall, lingering on Eilene, then Rin – a shared understanding of the chaos they’d fled. His eyes hardened. “Arnekol burns. Our own blood is spilled within Allemarea’s walls.” A ripple of anger went through the chieftains; Lyam’s name hung unspoken. “Caution has been our shield. No longer.”

He drew the Sword of Clans, its surface catching the firelight. “The shadow lengthens. It threatens our lands. To stand idle is to invite darkness. Tarthenia honours its oaths. We honour the fallen. Today, we answer fire with steel.” He turned to the envoys. “Tarthenia joins common cause with Kor and the survivors of Arnekol. We pledge our strength to ending Naimente’s reign.”

Naevin stepped forward, his scholar’s stoop less pronounced. “Kor builds with reason. But reason dictates some malignancies must be excised.” *Like the one that consumed Elara,* the thought hardened his resolve. “When tyranny consumes lives and truths, reason demands action. Kor stands with Tarthenia and Arnekol. For balance. For necessity.”

Eilene followed, gaze unwavering. “Arnekol is ash,” she stated, voice steady. “But its people endure. Naimente shattered the trust our commerce was built on. She burned our homes, murdered our kin. Survival demands retribution. Rebuilding demands justice. What remains of Arnekol pledges its resources, its resilience, to this cause. The ledger must be balanced.”

Oaths were sworn, ancient Tarthenian words mingling with Kor formulations and Arnekol declarations. No celebration followed, only a grim determination settling over the hall. Rin felt the alliance harden into the reality of war. Lyam’s face flashed behind her eyes – the terror, the plea. Grief was a whetstone, sharpening resolve.

The War Room was carved from the mountain, austere and functional. Maps lay across a massive oak table scarred by generations of campaigns. Weapon racks lined the stone walls. The air smelled of beeswax, old leather, and preparedness.

Rin stood at the table’s head, flanked by Naevin and Eilene. Dmar stood near the entrance, a silent sentinel. Her father observed from a corner, a silent affirmation of trust. Tarthenian commanders, veterans of border skirmishes and clan feuds, filled the remaining space.

“Assessments,” Rin began. “Allemarea.”

Naevin stepped forward, tapping the map. “Naimente’s army is disciplined, bound by fear and favour, and Allemarea has strong natural defenses. But intelligence suggests her rapid consolidation strains resources; supply lines are overextended, potentially vulnerable.” He paused. “And reports from Arnekol speak of unnatural weaponry. Fire that consumes stone, leaps water.”

A murmur ran through the commanders. Rin acknowledged it with a sharp nod. “Weaknesses beyond supply lines?”

“Potential dissent among nobles, though fear suppresses it for now,” Naevin continued. “And her command is centralized. Disrupt the head…”

Eilene leaned forward, her bandaged hand near the map. “Logistics are our challenge. Supply routes through the Spine are arduous. We need footholds closer to Allemarea, supply caches. Arnekol’s networks can track their shipments, identify vulnerabilities for disruption.”

Rin absorbed their counsel. Strike at supply lines, sow dissent, target Naimente’s control. “Our forces,” she stated. “Clan levies – fierce, know the terrain, adept at raiding but needing coordination. Kor offers intelligence. Arnekol offers resourcefulness and unmatched motivation.” She met the commanders’ eyes. “Allemarea expects siege. We give them neither.”

She leaned over the map, tracing lines. “We bleed them. Clan tactics, scaled. Swift raids on supply depots, communication lines. Hit-and-run strikes. Force Naimente to disperse her forces. We turn the mountains into their prison.” She looked up. “Targeted assassinations of key commanders loyal only to her.”

Silence. An older commander, Branoc, shifted. “Commander… assassination? It lacks honour.”

“Honour did not save Arnekol,” Rin countered, voice cold. “Nor my cousin. Naimente fights without rules. To bind ourselves is suicide. We fight to win.”

“These raids,” Branoc persisted, gesturing to the treacherous passes marked on the map. “Coordinating clans in unfamiliar territory, maintaining supply for sustained harassment… it’s a knife edge.”

“Which is where Arnekol’s networks and Kor intelligence become vital,” Eilene interjected smoothly. “Identifying paths, caches, timing strikes to coincide with vulnerable shipments.”

Rin nodded. “We exploit their rigidity. Flank attacks, night marches, feints. Draw their main force out, then strike the capital. Speed, surprise, and the land itself are our weapons.”

Debate followed – fierce, pragmatic. Timelines, reserves, contingencies. Rin held firm, adapting, countering, grief channelled into strategic fire. The plan coalesced, dangerous, audacious.

Night deepened, swallowing Greyfang Hold in shadow. The wind moaned through the peaks. Sleep eluded Rin. Command, ghosts, Lyam’s absence – they pressed close in the quiet dark of her chamber.

Fire crackled low in the hearth. She sat on a low stool, a block of dark *iver*wood in her lap. She picked up her carving knife, the worn handle familiar. Not the hawk she’d begun months ago – that felt tainted now. Instead, a wolf emerged under her blade. Head lowered, poised, feral.

The rhythmic scrape of blade against wood was a solitary ritual. Shaving by shaving, the shape took form. Each stroke a breath held, a loss acknowledged. The controlled precision channelled the chaos within. Here, the warrior could bleed grief without weakening the commander.

She thought of Naimente, wielding fire and fear. Of Naevin, his reason bent to war. Of Eilene, turning ledgers of loss into weapons. Of her father’s trust. And Lyam. Always Lyam. A debt etched deeper than any line carved into wood.

The knife bit deeper, shaping the wolf’s focus. The fire popped. Outside, the wind howled. Rin carved on, each stroke a promise made in shadow. The war had begun. She would see it through. The wolf in the wood began to look hungry.
