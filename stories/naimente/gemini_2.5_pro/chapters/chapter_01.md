# Chapter 1: Joining of Waters

*(Naimente POV)*

The water felt cool against her wrists, a silken weight in the Great Hall’s heavy air. *Daecil ar Korlith*, the officiant intoned, his voice echoing off the high, damp-streaked constellations overhead. *Water and Trust*. Naimente kept her gaze on the interlocking streams flowing through channels carved into the marble floor, swirling around the dais where she stood beside Aethen. Prince Aethen Aeldae. Her husband. The title felt alien, ill-fitting as the pearl-silk gown whispering against her skin.

Aethen’s hand rested lightly on her arm, his touch warm, anchoring her in this glittering hostility. He met her gaze, hazel eyes earnest, a silent promise transcending the ancient phrases and the weight of centuries. He believed in their hesitant vision: an Allemarea where water nourished all, not just these gilded few.

But their watching eyes were cold. She felt their scrutiny like pinpricks – lords and ladies draped in fabrics shimmering like fish scales, faces masks of polite disdain. Whispers carried on the damp air like spores: *“Northern village girl… barely literate…” “The mountain healer…” “Bewitched him…”* Her hands, scarred from grinding herbs and lancing boils, tightened within the ceremonial sleeves. The scars felt more real than the heavy gold rings Aethen had placed on her fingers. She was Naimente Kamame, daughter of the foothills, trained by Aedil, witness to fevers and droughts while palace fountains danced. That woman felt leagues removed from this Princess Naimente Aeldae.

The officiant raised a silver ewer, pouring water over their joined hands. *Ea eaole, ea daecil*. *And Tree, and Water*. The ritual spoke of union, life from the source. Yet Naimente saw the faint green tinge of algae in a shadowed floor channel, the chipped mosaic near Lord Vaendae’s slippered foot. Allemarea showed rot, even here. Determination hardened within her. She remembered Lyra, pale and small, a loss that forged a vow never to be helpless again. She would scour this decay. For Aethen. For Lyra’s memory. For herself.

The ceremony concluded. Polite applause rippled, thin as winter ice. Aethen squeezed her hand before facing the court, radiating quiet dignity. She stood beside him, chin high, meeting the assessing stares. Let them whisper. The waters were joined. What grew from it, she would command. The thought, sharp and sudden, sent a tremor not of fear, but of fierce resolve through her veins, settling deep as mountain roots.

*(Naevin POV)*

The procession spilled from the palace gates, a sluggish river of gold and white between banks of threadbare commoners. Naevin Daecilrith watched from a shaded balcony, fingers tracing the worn journal in his tunic. Beside him, Dmar Kasalkath stood impassive, Kor soldiery amidst Allemarean silks.

“Note the public water channels, Dmar,” Naevin murmured, blue eyes narrowed. “Half are dry, choked with refuse. Yet the palace fountains flowed as if the Source were infinite.”

Dmar grunted, gaze sweeping the hopeful, gaunt faces below. “Waste is power’s prerogative, Scholar.”

“It is unrest’s seed,” Naevin countered softly. Their hope seemed fixed on the slight figure beside the Prince in the litter. The commoner princess. Naimente. He’d seen her violet eyes during the brief audience—uncommon, intelligent, watchful. The court whispered *witchcraft*. Superstition? Or was her influence something more tangible? A desperate prince finding strength in an outsider, perhaps. Still, the narrative held power.

His thoughts drifted to Elara. His sister, come to study Allemarea’s water archives five years past. Then silence. Letters unanswered, inquiries met with silken obfuscation. His position as Kor's envoy was the perfect pretext to cut through it. Could she be among these faces? Or had this glittering, shadowed city swallowed her whole? The ache in his chest tightened.

The royal litter passed below. Prince Aethen, pale but serene. Princess Naimente, unnaturally still, dark hair stark against white silk, gaze fixed forward. A healer thrust into a decaying kingdom. An interesting paradox. Was she a genuine force for change, perhaps even an ally in finding Elara? Or another player in this stagnant game? His search felt suddenly bound to the fate of this water-logged kingdom and its violet-eyed princess.

*(Rin POV)*

The Grand Feast Hall’s air lay thick with spiced wine, roasted meat, and sickly perfume. Rin Tarthan kept her back straight, hands loose near the matched short swords beneath her tunic. Her green eyes scanned the room. Weakness. It radiated from the King slumped on his throne, from the courtiers’ brittle pride masking anxiety. Even the earnest Prince possessed a gentleness ill-suited to command this viper’s nest.

Her gaze flickered to a side table. Lyam. Her cousin, hostage in silk, his smile tight, eyes pleading across the distance. Tarthenia’s price for peace. The sight fueled a cold anger. These people, drowning in excess while provinces starved, held a Tarthan son as leverage. Her fingers twitched for her blades.

Then her attention settled on the new princess. Naimente. Composed amidst the chaos. Unlike the soft southerners, her features held the angular strength of her northern heritage – a hardness Rin recognized. Her violet eyes, sweeping the room, held no fear, only disconcerting intensity. They met Rin’s gaze for a fleeting instant – mutual assessment – before moving on.

A warrior’s instinct recognized something formidable. Not steel's strength, but the contained power of a deep river. Cleansing or drowning? The nobles murmured, *‘Common blood.’ ‘Insult to lineage.’* Fools. Blind to the potential threat, or ally.

Rin sipped water, ignoring the wine. Wits sharp. Her duty: observe, assess Allemarea’s stability, protect Tarthenia, secure Lyam. This commoner queen-to-be complicated everything. An unknown variable. One to exploit, perhaps? Or one that could shatter the board entirely. She caught Lyam's eye again, giving a near-imperceptible nod. *Patience.*

*(Eilene POV)*

Later, as the feast scattered into garden celebrations, Eilene Anaedrui moved among merchants and lesser nobles, fingers absently clicking the beads of her abacus. Calculation was second nature: the value of alliances, the flow of influence, profit and loss.

The wedding was Aethen’s gamble. Potential return? Stability, reform, a check on nobles stifling trade – *high value*. Risk? Chaos, civil strife, collapse disrupting trade routes – *extreme liability*. Arnekol thrived on stability. This union was volatile.

Near a sputtering fountain, two cloth merchants grumbled. “Mark me, Fenrir,” one slurred, “this ‘healer queen’ bankrupts us with peasant sympathies.”

“Or,” the other whispered, glancing around, “forces high lords to pay taxes. Imagine the relief! Common folk hope in her. A true heart, they say.”

Eilene tallied the sentiment. Hope versus fear. A volatile mix. Naimente’s background was the crux. A commoner understood burdens the nobility ignored. Effective power could streamline regulations, improve infrastructure—benefit Arnekol’s caravans immensely. But power corrupted. Could a village healer navigate these currents without being swept away?

She watched Naimente on a terrace with Aethen, overlooking city lights. Posture erect now, face intent in the torchlight. Eilene clicked a final bead. *Asset: Naimente Kamame. Status: Volatile. Recommendation: Observe closely. Cultivate caution. Hedge investments.* The ledger was open, the final balance dangerously uncertain.
