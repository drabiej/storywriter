# Chapter 8: The Merchant's Ledger

The Allemarean Weavers’ Guild Hall smelled of damp stone, lanolin, and age. Sunlight slanted through high arched windows, green-stained from decades of seepage, illuminating faded tapestries of ancient water rituals beside newer hangings of bustling looms. Beneath Eilene Anaedrui’s feet, worn marble paths met meticulous new repairs near the central channel where water now flowed briskly. Progress and decay. Allemarea presented a complex, unbalanced account, and Eilene instinctively began to tally it.

She sat at a heavy oak table, Arnekol aides flanking her, across from representatives of Allemarea’s new merchant council—smaller traders elevated by Naimente's reforms—and a quiet woman named Lyra Nev, from the Princess’s chancellery. Eilene kept her posture straight, hands near the abacus she carried by habit, its smooth beads a familiar weight.

“…standardized weights improved cross-guild margins by nearly three percent already,” stated Master Borin, the stout Mason. Months ago, he’d raged against Lord Vaendae’s obstructions; today, cautious satisfaction softened his face. “Fair measure benefits all, Highness’s representative.” He nodded towards Lyra Nev.

“Predictable outcomes foster reliable commerce,” Lyra replied, her voice even. She consulted her parchments. “Princess Naimente deems equitable exchange foundational. Permit processing times are likewise reduced by forty percent.”

Efficiency. Reduced friction. Naimente understood logistics. Changes implemented with startling speed, certainly helped by the vacuum Queen Iolara’s *accident* had created. A pragmatist noted such things.

“Arnekol appreciates these streamlined processes,” Eilene offered, her tone measured. “Stable markets encourage investment. We note, however, increased timber requisitions from the north, and significant iron allocations directed towards… infrastructure reinforcement?” Reports from her caravan masters spoke of bridge repairs, yes, but also fortified border passes and unusual forge activity. Resources that could enforce decrees as easily as build aqueducts—perhaps necessary, she conceded, against entrenched resistance like Vaendae’s.

Lyra Nev met her gaze coolly. “Allemarea rebuilds, Trade Princess. Decades of neglect require substantial resources. Roads, aqueducts, silos—all demand reinforcement for the kingdom’s security and sustenance.” Plausible. Yet *security* felt emphasized. A flicker in the eyes of the merchant beside Lyra? Eilene filed it away. And where, she wondered, was the earnest Prince Aethen in these discussions? Once the face of reform, his presence seemed diminished where hard resources were concerned. Sidelined, or focused elsewhere? Another variable.

A cloth merchant added, “Aye, and the northern road repairs mean quicker passage for our wool! Less loss!”

Gratitude versus strategic concern. Naimente’s reforms were undeniably oiling the gears of commerce, benefiting the very merchants long suppressed. Opposition felt counter-productive, economically. Yet the scale of resource movement hinted at ambitions beyond repair. *Dual-use infrastructure.* The thought struck her with the force of an entry on the wrong side of a ledger. Naimente wasn't just rebuilding; she was potentially arming. A risk to monitor closely.

The meeting concluded with tariff adjustments, favourable to Arnekol but fair. Naimente, or her proxy, drove a hard bargain. Eilene maintained cordiality, mind calculating ripple effects. An asset, this new regime, yet volatile. The potential for loss remained high.

Later, Eilene moved through the Great Market near the Serpent Gate. The air hummed with a vitality absent months ago—more stalls, displaying not just local produce but Tarthenian wool, Kor pottery, even coastal fish packed in ice. The scents of grilling meat, spices, and damp stone mingled.

Here, the ledger tilted towards asset. Faces seemed less drawn, clothing less patched. Children darted with more energy. Naimente’s water redistribution meant fuller cisterns, cleaner washing. Her crackdown on corrupt inspectors had tangible results.

“Trade Princess!” A basket seller beamed, face familiar from past, leaner visits. “Good river-reed, strong weave! Fair price now, thanks to Her Highness. No more skimming!” She held up a sturdy basket. “May the waters bless Princess Naimente!”

Nearby, a vendor polished *iver*-plums. “First time in years I can afford southern fruit, Your Excellency. The tariffs… she made things possible.” He lowered his voice. “We pray she keeps the nobles in check. They bled us dry.”

Eilene bought a plum, its sweet juice bursting against her tongue. This gratitude was genuine, palpable. It painted Naimente not as Lyra Nev’s calculating figure, nor Naevin’s unsettling presence, but as a saviour. How could one argue against visible improvements in ordinary lives?

Yet, she noted uniformed guards, more numerous than before, gazes watchful. A new notice board displayed decrees regarding curfews and restrictions on gatherings—framed as necessary for order. She saw relief on faces, yes, but also a caution learned under older regimes, not yet unlearned. Prosperity flourished alongside control, inextricably linked. The merchant’s pragmatism warred with an unease the numbers couldn't quantify.

As twilight bruised the sky violet, Eilene slipped into an alley near the Merchants’ Quay. The air smelled of damp rope, river silt, tar. Warehouses loomed. Beneath a loading crane’s shadow, a cloaked figure waited – Maris, a trusted factor, arrived ostensibly with spices. The low gurgle of water against stone mingled with the faint creak of distant rigging.

No words wasted. Eilene passed a small scroll sealed with Arnekol’s mark – coded observations on trade flows, resource diversions, market sentiment, tightening security. Confirmation of Naevin’s concerns about missing records, woven into inventory discrepancies. A query on Allemarean purchases of strategic metals abroad.

Maris countered with a waxed cloth cylinder. Inside: coded updates from Arnekol – trade house politics, border tensions. Confirmation that Naevin’s reports via this channel reached Kor safely. A relayed query: *Frequency of ‘Security Detainments’ rising? Pattern?*

Eilene nodded grimly. Kevan’s fear, relayed by Naevin, confirmed the trend. Another debit on the hidden ledger.

“The *iver*-wood shipment,” Maris murmured, code for the next contact. “Five days.”

“Acknowledged,” Eilene replied softly. “Safe passage.”

Maris melted towards the quay. Eilene lingered, the clammy river air clinging to her skin. Prudent risk management, this clandestine exchange. Yet it sat uneasily beside the market square’s genuine hope. Hedging investments, preparing for catastrophe, even while profiting from stability. Arnekol instincts applied to conspiracy. A necessary counter-balance, perhaps, against a power proving both beneficial and unnerving. The ledger remained open, its final sum terrifyingly unclear.
