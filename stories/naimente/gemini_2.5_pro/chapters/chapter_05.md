# Chapter 5: Poison and Remedy

*(Aethen POV)*

The King’s study felt older than the palace, steeped in the scent of decaying parchment and beeswax. Shadows clung to bookcases laden with Allemarean histories, their leather spines cracked like dry earth. Maps of a kingdom once vibrant with watercourses hung beside windows overlooking gardens where fountains played with diminished vigour. Aethen often found solace here, sketching petitioners’ faces, but tonight a different weight pressed upon him, cold and unfamiliar.

His father slept nearby, breathing shallow, his cough worsening. The physicians spoke of age, of burdens borne too long. But Aethen saw a flicker in the King's eyes—not weariness, but a deep exhaustion, a dulling of his spark. He remembered his mother’s hand, always ready with an herbal tonic, supposedly for strength.

He sought the Silverstream treaty scroll, hoping for precedent against Lord Vaendae’s water diversions – the very injustice Kevan had pleaded against. His gaze snagged on a small, carved box behind seldom-consulted philosophies. Inlaid with mother-of-pearl *neph*-vines – his mother’s favoured motif. Unease prickled. He lifted the lid.

Inside, on dark velvet: stoppered crystal vials. One held clear liquid, another greyish powder. A third, nearly empty, held dregs of a dark, viscous substance. The scent hit him – metallic, unnervingly familiar from his father’s evening goblet. *Lecil*-root extract. Known to healers, in tiny doses, to ease pain. In larger, steady doses… to slow the heart, cloud the mind, mimic age until the body simply… stopped.

The air thickened. The maps blurred. His mother. The tonic. The King’s decline. Kevan’s plea, Orman’s greed, the rot Naimente spoke of—festering while his mother… The pieces clicked into place, sickeningly precise. Blood drained from his face, leaving his skin cold. *No. It cannot be.*

Silk rustled behind him. Queen Iolara stood framed in the doorway, her expression difficult to read, sapphires at her throat like ice chips.

“Aethen? What keeps you so late?” Her voice held its usual cadence, devoid of warmth.

He turned slowly, the near-empty vial heavy in his trembling hand. Betrayal was a physical blow, stealing his breath. “Mother… what is this?” His voice was a raw whisper.

Her eyes flickered to the vial, then met his. No shock. No denial. Just a chilling stillness. “A remedy, my son. For the King’s… discomforts.”

“Discomforts?” The word choked him. “Or poison? To hasten… to control?” The accusation shattered the room’s quiet antiquity. For power, she would let the kingdom wither?

Iolara stepped into the study, closing the door softly. Her regal composure hardened into something brittle. “Your father weakens, Aethen. He fades. Allemarea needs a firm hand on the tiller. Someone who understands tradition, lineage.” Her gaze sharpened. “Someone who won’t let that northern healer’s whispers undo centuries of rule.”

He recoiled. “You do this… for power? Against Naimente?”

“I do this for Allemarea,” she countered, voice low and fierce. “For *you*. You are too easily swayed. She offers change, but she will break us. I preserve what is rightfully ours.”

“Ours?” Anguish warred with horror. “By poison? Watching him wither? He is your husband! My father!”

“He is a king failing his duty,” she stated, unmoved. “And I am a queen protecting her realm and her son’s future from sentiment.” She reached for the vial. “Give it to me, Aethen. Forget this. It is necessary.”

He flinched away, clutching the vial. *Necessary*. The word echoed Naimente’s justifications, twisted and monstrous. He saw his mother not as the figure of his childhood, but a stranger cloaked in chilling resolve. His world crumbled. “No,” he whispered, the word fragile against the flood of horror. “Never.”

*(Naimente POV)*

The knock on their chamber door the following night was frantic. One of Aethen’s attendants, pale-faced. “Princess… the Prince requests you. Urgently. The King’s private suite.”

Naimente found Aethen pacing the outer room, his calm shattered, face tight with sleeplessness and strain. Through an archway, King Caelwin slumped in a chair near the hearth, looking bewildered, a goblet beside him. The air vibrated.

“Aethen, what is it?” Naimente asked softly.

Before he could answer, the connecting door swung open. Queen Iolara entered, composure regained, though her eyes held a dangerous light. “Aethen. We must speak. Alone.”

“No,” Aethen said, voice flat. He stepped towards the archway. “Father, Mother has been putting something harmful in your tonic.”

The King blinked, struggling to focus. “Harmful? Iolara? No, my dear, it eases…”

“It’s poison, Father!” Aethen’s voice cracked. “Slow poison!”

Iolara drew herself up, fury radiating. “Lies! Spurred by this ambitious viper!” Her gaze fixed on Naimente, venomous. “She turns son against mother, seeks to usurp—”

“Enough!” Aethen stepped between them, shielding Naimente. “I saw the vials. I know what you’ve done.”

The King struggled to rise, hand trembling. “Iolara… surely…?”

Exposed. Seeing the King’s dawning comprehension, Aethen’s resolve. Something snapped in the Queen. Her face contorted. A strangled cry. She lunged—not at Aethen, but past him, towards the frail King, hand clawing for the goblet on the nearby table. To silence him? Finish the dose? A final, desperate act.

“Father!” Aethen surged forward, blocked by his mother’s sudden movement.

Naimente reacted. Healer’s instinct, fighter’s reflex. She moved, intercepting the Queen, trying to force her back. Iolara twisted violently, nails scoring Naimente’s arm. A chaotic collision. Silk and fury. The Queen stumbled—caught on the rug?—and fell backward. Hard.

Her head struck the sharp corner of the ornate hearth surround. Carved stone water gods watched impassively. A sickening crack echoed in the sudden silence.

Absolute. Horrifying.

Queen Iolara lay still. Eyes wide, unseeing. Dark blood seeped from beneath her hair, staining the marble. The sapphires at her throat seemed to pulse, then dimmed.

Naimente stared. Hand pressed to her bleeding arm. The Queen’s fury echoed. *Accident?* Her mind struggled. The crack. The stillness. Blood. A wave of panic washed over her, cold and sharp— Lyra’s face flashed, the helplessness she’d vowed never to feel again. *Never helpless.* Her arm stung. Aethen’s strangled gasp. The King’s trembling. *Control.* This wasn’t healing. This was chaos. Her reforms needed stability. Survival demanded control. The hollow ache deepened, but resolve hardened over it like cooling lava. She met Aethen’s horrified gaze.

Aethen knelt beside his mother, face blank with shock, hands hovering. King Caelwin stared, mouth slack, shaking.

Naimente forced herself to check for a pulse. None. She straightened slowly, the cold resolve solidifying. *A tragic accident. Overwrought… stumbled…* It had to be. Survival. “She fell,” Naimente stated, voice unnervingly steady, the lie scraping her soul. “She struck her head. A terrible accident.” True and false. Brittle as glass. The first crack in her foundation.

*(Rotating Foreign POVs - Naevin, Rin, Eilene)*

News spread: *The Queen is dead.* The official story formed – a tragic accident, agitated, a fall near the hearth, fatal blow. Condolences offered, mourning decreed.

Later, in a discreet room within the diplomatic quarter, the three foreign representatives met.

*(Naevin POV)*
Naevin adjusted his spectacles, reviewing notes – whispers, guards’ faces, sealed chambers. “An accident,” he murmured. “Conveniently removing the Princess’s chief opponent.” He looked at the others. “Agitation, a stumble. Plausible, yet… incomplete.” Patterns clicked. Poison suspected, confrontation, sudden death. He thought of Elara, lost in these shadows.

*(Rin POV)*
Rin’s face was grim. “Plausible, perhaps. The timing… precise.” Her mind analyzed forces. Cornered Queen, discovering Prince, influential Princess. “An ‘agitated fall’? Requires momentum, surprise… or force. Was she pushed? Did she lunge? At whom?” The ambiguity felt deliberate. She thought of Lyam, held captive by this volatile court. Stakes sharpened.

*(Eilene POV)*
Eilene tallied the ledger. *Asset: Iolara (removed). Liability: Instability (increased). Opportunity: Reform path clearer (trade benefits?). Risk: Ruthlessness (threat?).* “Physicians swift,” she noted dryly. “Body prepared immediately. Limited examination. Tidy.” She met Naevin’s frown, Rin’s contained fury. “The official story serves Princess Naimente perfectly. Design or fortune, her path is clearer.” She tapped the table. “We agree? Scrutiny is warranted. We continue observing. Separately, sharing pertinent findings.”

Silent assent. Scholar, warrior, merchant – bound by circumstance, deepening suspicion. Their network solidified, forged in the shadow of a Queen’s convenient death. Allemarea’s currents darkened.
