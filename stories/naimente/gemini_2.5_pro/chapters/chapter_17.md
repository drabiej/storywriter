# Chapter 17: Just Measures

The Sunken Plaza simmered. Tension met the humid morning air, thick with the smell of anxious sweat, damp stone, and a metallic undertone of fear. Crown and blue flame banners hung limp. Water murmured through newly restored channels, Naimente’s work, yet the sound felt jarring against the grim anticipation.

At the plaza’s heart stood a stark wooden platform. A dozen figures knelt there, bound and gagged – captured sympathizers, gossiping servants, minor nobles who’d spoken unwisely after the King’s death. Below, a sea of faces watched: curious, grimly satisfied, afraid. Captain Perrin stood near the steps, her stillness a bulwark against the unease.

Naimente emerged onto the overlooking dais, flanked by her advisors. Aethen was absent, secluded by supposed grief and duty. She wore severe, regal blue, a silver circlet gleaming in her dark hair. Her violet eyes swept the crowd, missing little – the fear, the resentment flickering in certain well-dressed onlookers near the edges.

Silence fell. Naimente stepped forward, her voice carrying, clear and cold.

“People of Allemarea! Last night, traitors struck within these walls. An attempt upon my life. An attack upon the stability we strive to rebuild.” Her gaze pierced the onlookers. “Orchestrated by foreign powers who fear our renewal. Powers who exploit our grief and sow chaos.”

She paused, letting fear mix with indignation. “These foreign courts – Kor, Tarthenia, Arnekol – find allies among the weak-willed, the resentful.” Her gesture encompassed the kneeling figures.

“These,” she declared, voice hardening, “are conspirators. Vipers who welcomed foreign influence, aided enemy agents, plotted violence. They sought to shatter our peace.”

Her gaze fixed on the bound prisoners. “The chaos they sought has found them. Treason demands a price. Allemarea demands security. These are not acts of vengeance.” Her voice resonated with chilling conviction. “These are just measures. Necessary wounds to excise a poison.”

She turned to Captain Perrin. A sharp, absolute nod. “Carry out the sentence.”

Naimente did not watch the swift work that followed. Gasps, sickening thuds, then silence – she registered them only as confirmation. The cost of order. She remained facing the plaza, chin high, projecting unwavering resolve while the price was paid behind her. A familiar heat pulsed behind her ribs, reminiscent of Ruinek's ancient stones—a solid core burning away doubt, leaving only cold purpose. This demonstration was critical.

The War Council Chamber felt like a gilded cage. Maps covered the long table, marked with troop positions. Sunlight slanted through high windows, illuminating dust motes and strained faces. Lord Caelin Vaendae sat near the foot, his usual disdain replaced by wary stillness. Lady Maeve Thurinal was absent.

Naimente presided, Aethen’s chair beside her pointedly empty. Before her lay parchments – reports, intercepted messages, fabricated intelligence from Perrin’s agents.

“My lords, Commanders,” Naimente began, calm and precise. “The assassination attempt confirms external threats intensify.” She slid a document across the table. “Intercepted correspondence. Arnekol trade factors and known dissidents.” Fabricated, but plausible. “Collusion. Funding for unrest, plans to disrupt vital northern timber shipments.”

General Maran frowned. “Arnekol? They benefit from the new trade regulations, Highness.”

“Precisely,” Naimente countered smoothly. “They profit while seeking leverage. They fear a strengthened Allemarea.” She produced another scroll. “Reports confirm Arnekol amasses strategic materials beyond declared need. Their border patrols probe near the Rin River pass. The attempt bears their hallmarks – deniable, reliant on proxies.”

Lord Vaendae shifted, eyes narrowed, searching her face. Suspicious, silent. Naimente held his gaze a moment too long, a silent reminder of the morning’s events.

“This cannot stand,” she declared, rising slightly. “We cannot wait for them to strike again, choke our resources. Allemarea must act decisively. Preemptively.”

A commander hesitated. “A preemptive strike, Highness? The risks—”

Naimente let the silence hang for a beat, her gaze steady and unnerving, before cutting him off, voice sharp. “The risks of inaction are greater. They mistake our focus on renewal for weakness. A swift, surgical strike to secure the Rin River pass, neutralize their positions, confiscate their resources. Frame it as border security.” She looked around the table, daring dissent. “We demonstrate strength. We secure our future. Objections?”

Silence. Vaendae stared at the table. Maran exchanged an uneasy glance with another commander but said nothing. The momentum was hers.

“Excellent,” she stated. “General Maran, draft the operational plan. Speed, overwhelming force. Captain Perrin will coordinate internal security. We move within the week.” She gathered the parchments. The decision made. The war demanded. Arnekol would provide.

Later, the chill between them felt colder than the moonlit marble of their chambers. Aethen stood by the window, back rigid, gazing at the sleeping city. The faint murmur of the water channels seemed hesitant. Naimente watched him, impatience warring with a ghost of tenderness.

“Aethen.”

He turned slowly. Grief warred with horror in his eyes. “The plaza, Naimente. Executions. Publicly.” His voice was rough.

“Traitors were punished,” she stated flatly. “A necessary message.”

“A message of terror!” he countered, stepping towards her. “And now… war? Against Arnekol? Based on whispers? Forged reports?” His gaze searched hers, desperate. “Naimente, this is madness! This isn’t security; it’s aggression! It’s what my mother…” He broke off.

“It is survival, Aethen,” she replied, voice dangerously quiet. “They conspire against us. We strike first, or we perish.”

“Or we become the monsters we fight!” he cried, control shattering. “Lyam executed, nobles purged, war drums… Where is the healer I married? Where is the justice we dreamed of?” His hands clenched. “This path leads only to more blood. Stop. Please, Naimente. Before it consumes everything.”

His plea struck not her heart, but her resolve, hardening it. He didn’t understand. His gentleness felt like a weight. She saw a surge of impatience rise within her, quickly suppressed.

She stepped back, creating distance. “Sentiment clouds your judgment, Aethen,” she said, her voice devoid of warmth. “You lack the strength required. Your grief makes you vulnerable. Rule requires clarity… hardness.”

He recoiled, face paling, eyes filling with devastated understanding. “Hardness,” he whispered. “Or emptiness?”

Naimente turned away, refusing to witness the final break. “I do what must be done. For Allemarea.” She walked towards the door, leaving him in the cold moonlight. His horror, his judgment – irrelevant now. Another factor to manage. The thread connecting her to the past had snapped. Only the cold certainty remained, demanding action.
