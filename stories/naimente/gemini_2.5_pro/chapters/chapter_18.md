# Chapter 18: The Purifying Flame

*(Naimente POV)*

Dawn cast long shadows over the staging camp above the Rin valley. Mist clung to the hollows, obscuring distant Arnekol. Here, the air held the sharp tang of oiled steel and damp earth, a stark contrast to the Allemarean court. Tents stood in disciplined rows; banners of Crown and Blue Flame snapped in the chill breeze.

Naimente stood within the command tent, lantern light catching her angular features. Maps lay spread across a rough table. General Maran, face impassive beneath grizzled hair, awaited confirmation, posture rigid. Outside, the murmur of troops preparing was a grim counterpoint to waking birdsong.

“Dispositions set, General?” Naimente’s voice was low, cutting the quiet tension. Her gaze fixed on the map: Arnekol’s defenses, trade routes, guild halls. Targets.

“As commanded, Highness,” Maran confirmed. “First wave secures river crossings and outer plazas. Second wave presses towards the Treasury and Grand Exchange. Our specialized units…” He hesitated, unease flickering across his features. “…are prepared.”

“The cleansing elements,” Naimente clarified, voice dropping slightly. “Ensure deployment is precise. Contained where possible, but decisive.” Arnekol festers. Her mind flashed to coded grain shipments, whispers of alliance. Treason. Enough. “Its corrupting influence must be cauterized.” She traced a line bisecting the city’s heart. The familiar warmth pulsed beneath her ribs, Ruinekaria’s echo confirming necessity. Not destruction, she told herself. Purification. *Tarash*. Fire.

“Highness,” Maran began, voice tight, “the potential for… collateral damage…”

Naimente met his gaze, cold and unwavering. “General, *all* war is collateral damage. Arnekol chose this when they plotted against us.” She straightened, radiating authority. “This is not conquest. It is surgery. Excise the rot. Execute the plan. Swiftly.”

Maran swallowed, unease settling into grim acceptance. He bowed stiffly. “As you command.”

“The waters cleanse, General,” Naimente corrected softly, gaze distant, fixed on the unseen city. “But sometimes, only fire can purify.” She dismissed him with a nod, turning back to the map, alone with the lamplight and the weight of decision. Her hands were steady now.

*(Eilene POV)*

Eilene Anaedrui stood on a high balcony overlooking Arnekol’s Plaza of Balanced Scales. Below, the morning market hummed—merchants calling wares, the clatter of coins, scents of spice and river-fish. Sunlight glinted off the Grand Exchange’s brass scales. Yet beneath the vibrancy, tension thrummed.

Her desperate return from Allemarea met disbelief, then grudging acceptance. Her warnings to the council yielded only cautious debate. *Naimente wouldn’t dare.* Fools, calculating profit and loss, blind to the fire she’d seen in Naimente’s eyes. She had pleaded, leveraged contacts to bolster defenses. Too little, too late.

A tremor ran through the flagstones. Not earthquake—deeper. A low concussion rolled across the plaza, silencing the market. Heads turned east. Another tremor, stronger. Then, a sound like tearing cloth, magnified immensely, ripped the air.

Smoke plumed from the east, thick and black. Too fast. Too many. Shouts erupted below, confusion turning to panic. Distant screams carried on the breeze.

Then came the fire.

Unlike any fire Eilene had known. It erupted not just from impacts but bloomed outward, impossibly fast, leaping canals meant to be firebreaks. The flames burned unnaturally, shifting colours—sickly green, harsh violet—within the inferno. The air grew thick, hot, tasting of ash and something metallic, chemical… or worse.

Chaos engulfed the plaza. People ran screaming, trampling stalls. Klaxons wailed, futile against the roar. Eilene gripped the railing, knuckles white, horror freezing her. She saw the Grand Exchange consumed, its brass scales melting like gold tears. Trading houses vanished into pyres.

Heat washed over her. Her mind struggled to grasp the scale, the unnatural speed. This wasn’t warfare; it was annihilation. Naimente’s “purifying flame.”

Instinct overriding shock, she turned, shouting orders to her guards. “West Gate! Secure passage! Gather who you can!” The roar intensified, heat palpable through stone. Below, a vision of hell: figures engulfed in sudden bursts of violet flame, canals boiling, stone cracking.

She stumbled down interior stairs, collapse echoing, the smell acrid. Her city, stability, reason itself—consumed by Naimente’s madness. Resolve hardened within the horror. Survive. Witness. *Find them.* Rin, Naevin, Dmar... A debt accrued in ash and lives. A debt to be paid.

*(Naimente POV)*

Miles away, on a windswept ridge, Naimente watched smoke pillar against the blue sky. Arnekol’s demise was a faint rumble, like distant thunder. The mist burned away, revealing the valley floor: Arnekol bleeding smoke and fire, a dark wound.

Wind whipped dark hair across her face. She felt nothing. No remorse, no triumph. Only cold clarity. The wind carried the faint tang of burning pitch. She noted it impassively. Purification. She raised scarred hands, slowly beginning the meticulous motion of washing them without water. Cleansing.

She saw not homes collapsing, but corruption excised, a threat cauterized. The unnatural colours flared—Perrin delivered. Fear bloomed alongside fire, cleansing the rot Ruinekaria warned of. *Tarash*. Necessary. Its resistance, its infection—cleansed.

This fire was the price of healing the continent. A necessary wound. Aethen couldn't see it; the foreigners would condemn her. Let them. History would understand.

The smoke climbed, a dark monument. Naimente watched, violet eyes reflecting distant flames, unwavering. A cold satisfaction settled, absolute as bedrock. Purification. Order. Her will consuming resistance. The chilling certainty of righteousness.
