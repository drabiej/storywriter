# Chapter 16: Mercy's Edge

The private garden exhaled coolness into the stifling palace night. Moonlight sculpted shadows from *iverwood* benches and turned *aivle*-blossoms ghostly, their scent heavy, almost funereal. Naimente stood beside the water channel snaking through the flagstones. Its murmur, usually soothing, felt accusatory, whispering echoes of recent chaos: Eilene’s defiance, Rin’s fury, Dmar’s retreat. And Lyam Tarthan. Executed. *A necessary wound,* Perrin had termed it. Efficient. Brutal.

Naimente knelt, trailing scarred fingers in the cool water. The faint web on her hand felt alien against the memory of signing Perrin’s dispatch—confirming the execution after the escape. *Secure the state. Eliminate threats.* Clean words for bloody work. Lyra’s small face flickered behind her eyes, the King’s dissolving gaze, the Queen’s surprise. Necessary wounds. A healer’s logic bent to a ruler’s need. Tonight, the justification felt thin as old cloth.

She withdrew her hand, watching water bead and drip. A compulsion rose, urgent. Dipping her hands again, she rubbed them slowly, meticulously, washing phantom stains the water couldn't touch—dungeon grit, imagined blood, the cloying scent of *ubel*-shade. Scrubbed until her skin felt raw, the ritual offering only illusory purity.

“Naimente?”

She startled, turning. Aethen stood in the arched doorway, silhouetted against lamplight. Grief softened his features, but his gaze held a new, painful clarity. He approached slowly, his presence disrupting the garden's quiet.

“You couldn't sleep?” she asked, rising, smoothing her night robe, hiding damp hands.

“Sleep?” His voice was low, roughened. “How? Eilene captured, then escaped… Dmar wounded… And Lyam…” He faltered. “Executed, Naimente. Like a traitor.”

“A necessity, Aethen,” she began, the familiar words automatic. “His family conspires. The escape attempt forced—”

“Forced your hand?” Aethen cut in, anguish sharpening his tone. “Or gave you an excuse? Kevan the gardener—punished. Cook Rennik—vanished. Now Lyam. Killed. Is this the Allemarea we promised them in the Sunken Plaza?”

His words struck raw nerves. She turned away, facing the whispering water. “You don’t understand the pressures—”

“I understand brutality,” he countered, stepping closer, voice trembling. “I understand fear replacing hope. Naimente, look at me.”

She turned slowly. His hazel eyes burned. “This path… it hardens you. My mother saw enemies everywhere. It poisoned her. Are we becoming her?”

The accusation landed like a blow. Ice spread through her veins. “That’s unfair.”

“Is it?” He took her hands—the hands she’d tried to cleanse. His touch was warm, earnest. “Remember the healer who saved my life? With skill and courage, not calculation? The woman who wept for Lyra?” His grip tightened. “Mercy, Naimente. Compassion. They aren’t weaknesses. They're the core of the strength we sought. Show mercy. Pull back from this edge. Before it’s too late. For Allemarea. For us.”

His raw plea pierced the armor she’d carefully constructed. Vulnerability washed over her—terrifying. Lyra’s face, Aedil’s wisdom, the clarity of herbs—memories surfaced, poignant, accusing. Had she lost that path? Could she turn back? The cold resolve within her wavered, threatened by his belief, the echo of her former self. Doubt gripped her. Tears pricked her eyes. Perhaps… perhaps he was right.

She opened her mouth to grasp the fragile hope—

A crash shattered the night. Shouts erupted from the corridor. Urgent. Violent.

Naimente shoved Aethen behind her, instinct taking over. She spun towards the archway, peering into the dim passage. Dancing shadows. The clang of steel.

“Assassins! Protect the Queen!” A guard’s cry, choked off.

Cold adrenaline surged, obliterating her vulnerability. *They* came for her. Here. Aethen’s plea felt naive, dangerous. Weakness invited attack. This proved it.

Two figures burst through the archway, dark leather, blades glinting. Eyes fixed on her, lethal. Behind them, a palace guard lay crumpled.

No time for fear. The healer vanished. The survivor emerged. She seized a heavy ceramic planter—earth and *celen*-leaf—heaving it at the first attacker.

He stumbled. The second lunged. Naimente dodged, using a bench as shield, shouting for Aethen to stay back. Steel scraped stone. A horn blared frantically within the palace. Footsteps pounded closer.

The first attacker recovered, pressing forward. The insignia stitched on his tunic—Lord Eren’s household. Vaendae’s faction. Extinction, not just restraint.

She evaded desperately—no warrior, but quick, cornered. The second assassin lunged again. She twisted, stumbling near the water channel, foot slipping on damp stone. Cold dread seized her as she fell—

Captain Perrin materialized in the archway, sword drawn, guards flanking her. Their intervention was brutal, efficient. Steel flashed. The assassins, caught, were swiftly overpowered. One lay dead, Perrin’s blade crimson. The other wrestled, spitting curses.

Perrin surveyed the scene, impassive, gaze flicking from Naimente to the captive, then to Aethen, pale near the doorway. “Highness, are you harmed?”

Naimente pushed herself up, trembling with cold fury. Her robe was torn, her arm grazed. She touched the sting, ignoring it. Aethen rushed to her side.

“Naimente! Alright?”

She pushed his hand away gently, gaze fixed on the surviving assassin, whose eyes burned with hate. Mercy. Aethen had pleaded for mercy. This was the result. Weakness exploited. They forced her hand. Always.

The brief doubt felt like foolish indulgence. Aethen’s warmth extinguished, smothered by icy certainty. The nascent power within her, the cold fire first felt against ancient stones, surged—no longer ambiguous, but absolute. Control. Ruthless. Any deviation invited destruction.

“Unharmed, Captain,” Naimente said, her voice clear, sharp as steel. “Secure the prisoner. Learn who sent them.” She met Perrin’s steady gaze. “And double the guards. Everywhere. Trust no one.”

She turned from the aftermath, away from Aethen, who recoiled slightly, his hand falling limp, the hopeful light in his eyes extinguished as he stared, uncomprehending. She walked back towards the palace, leaving the scent of blossoms and blood behind. Mercy’s edge had crumbled. There was no turning back. Only the path ahead, paved with necessary wounds and cold fire.
