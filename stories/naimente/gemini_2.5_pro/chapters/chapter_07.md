# Chapter 7: The Scholar's Puzzle

The air in the Royal Archives lay thick, heavy with the scent of centuries—dry parchment, crumbling leather, dust like fine silt. Lamplight cast long shadows, turning familiar alcoves into hidden depths where silence felt expectant. Naevin Daecilrith moved slowly between towering shelves of age-stained wood, fingers trailing across scrolls and codices. Beside him, Dmar Kasalkath stood impassive, a block of Kor soldiery amidst the fragile decay, his gaze sweeping the corners.

“Here,” Naevin murmured, pulling down a heavy ledger bound in water-stained hide. He carried it to a scarred reading table, blowing dust off a cleared rectangle. Motes danced in the lamplight. “*Annals of the Third Reign Decline. Account of the Great Drought.*” His ink-smudged fingers carefully turned brittle pages, archaic Allemarean script dense and precise.

He’d spent weeks here, ostensibly researching trade history—a cover. His search for Elara yielded only polite dismissals suggesting she’d simply… left. But years in Kor’s libraries had honed his instincts. He sensed dissonance beneath the court’s placid surface, amplified by the Queen’s sudden death and the commoner Princess’s swift consolidation of power through popular reform.

“Listen, Dmar.” Naevin traced a passage. “‘*…Year of Failing Springs… High Reservoirs dwindled… strife grew. Lord Kaelen diverted the River Rin… city nobles maintained pleasure fountains… The King, weakened by grief after Queen Lyra’s sudden passing, unable to enforce decree. Unrest… harsh measures by the King’s Hand… vital scrolls on water rights vanished from these archives…*’”

Naevin looked up, eyes sharp behind his spectacles. “A drought. A weakened King. A Queen’s controversial death. A powerful figure imposing order. Vanishing records.” He tapped the page. “It mirrors now. King Gerrad weakens, Queen Iolara dies conveniently. Princess Naimente rises, enforcing reforms, displacing nobles like Vaendae.” He gestured towards a gap on a nearby shelf. “And the *Water Treaties Compendium, Fourth Reign Supplement*—precisely detailing precedents against Vaendae’s claims—is missing.” A chill deepened as he recalled Elara's last letter, excitedly mentioning that very *Compendium* and its unusual marginalia on drought precedents. "The Archivist claims ‘water damage,’ but the scrolls nearby are untouched."

Dmar grunted. “Patterns repeat, Scholar. Doesn’t prove the Princess is behind it.”

Naevin’s hand tightened on the ledger. “No,” he clipped out. “But the resonance… it feels deliberate. History manipulated, or cycling.” The thrill of discovery warred with a colder dread. Had Elara stumbled onto this pattern? “Other gaps too. Records on border forts during the Second Tarthenian Impasse—gone. Grain shipment ledgers from the Grey Famine—pages torn out.” He leaned closer. “Resource control… military action… Someone's erasing the precedents for crises. Clearing the way?”

Dmar shifted. “Or neglected archives. Rats. Damp. Thieves.” He glanced at the Chief Archivist dozing nearby. “Hardly efficient.”

“Perhaps,” Naevin conceded, closing the ledger. The puzzle remained incomplete, its emerging shape unsettling. He needed Kor’s meticulous records. “Tonight, Dmar. We send the message.”

Evening painted the Grand Hall in amber and rose. The diplomatic reception, celebrating trade adjustments favouring Arnekol, hummed with forced cordiality beneath drifting music. Goblets clinked. Silks rustled. Naevin stood near a marble pillar, observing. Water channels crisscrossing the floor gleamed, cleaner than they had been in months—Naimente’s influence made tangible.

She entered flanked not by Aethen, but by Captain Perrin and two stern advisors. Her gown, deep blue like twilight water, was rich but severe. A silver circlet seemed less ornament than authority. She moved with a new, almost martial rigidity. Her violet eyes, once compassionate, now swept the room with unnerving focus—assessing, calculating.

She paused with Eilene Anaedrui, the Arnekol merchant looking satisfied; Naimente’s streamlined regulations clearly benefited her. A brief nod to the Tarthenian envoy, Rin Tarthan, who offered a stiff bow. Threat or opportunity? Naimente’s interactions were brief, precise. Her smile rarely reached her eyes. Even established nobles showed deference tinged with… fear?

Lord Vaendae watched her pass, muttering resentfully. Lady Maeve Thurinal observed Naimente with a troubled gaze. Factions solidified around, or against, the Princess.

Naimente’s gaze met Naevin’s. No recognition, just cool assessment before moving on. A chill unrelated to the hall’s faint dampness touched him. The passionate healer was overlaid with something colder, harder. He remembered hopeful faces in the Sunken Plaza, the real improvements Torwen confirmed. Good deeds built on… what? The thought left a cold knot in his stomach.

“She commands the room,” Dmar observed quietly at his elbow. “More than the King.”

“Fear as well as loyalty,” Naevin murmured. “A dangerous balance.” His gaze followed her. The puzzle deepened, its pieces shifting towards a picture he feared to complete.

Later, under a slivered moon, they stood in a damp passage behind the kitchens. Stale grease, lye soap, the chill of deep stone. Water dripped rhythmically. Their informant arrived cloaked, glancing nervously before approaching—Kevan, Lyra’s father, face weary but holding a spark of hope Naimente had ignited. He tended the palace herb garden now, thanks to her early patronage.

“Scholar,” Kevan greeted quietly. “Not easy.”

“We’re grateful, Kevan,” Naevin said. “News?”

Kevan twisted his cap. “She does good, Scholar. My Mira weaves now, fair wages. Others too. Water flows better in Silverstream. Vaendae’s men backed off after the steward was… questioned.” He swallowed. “But things feel tight. Guards everywhere. People whisper careful. Cook got taken away last week—grumbling about grain prices. ‘Sowing unrest,’ they said.”

A knot tightened in Naevin’s stomach. “Questioned? Taken away? By whom?”

“Captain Perrin’s folk. Orders from the Princess’s office, they say. Always ‘security.’ ‘Against instability.’ Servants watch each other. Don’t know who might report.” Kevan looked down. “She fixed the channels, aye. But she’s building walls too. Invisible ones.” He met Naevin’s eyes, gratitude mixed with fear. “Is this… what reform feels like, Scholar?”

The question hung heavy in the damp air. Naevin had no easy answer. Progress tangled with oppression. “Thank you, Kevan. Vital information. Be careful.”

Kevan nodded grimly and vanished into the shadows.

Naevin turned to Dmar, detachment yielding to grim certainty. “Kevan confirms it. Good deeds masking an iron fist. Surveillance. Suppression.” He took a breath. “We must warn Kor. Tonight.”

Dmar nodded, already scanning the passage. “The courier awaits. Coded?”

“Triple-layered.” Naevin retrieved a small, sealed scroll. Kor cipher within trade analysis, addressed to Archivist Maelor. *Historical parallels. Missing records (incl. Compendium Elara noted). Growing authoritarianism. Request immediate comparative analysis, Reign Three archives & water-rights precedents.* A plea for knowledge, a warning shot.

As Dmar melted away to deliver the message, Naevin lingered, the damp chill seeping into him. This was no longer academic. The puzzle was alive, dangerous. Its pieces pointed towards a dark future for Allemarea—and perhaps, towards Elara’s fate.
