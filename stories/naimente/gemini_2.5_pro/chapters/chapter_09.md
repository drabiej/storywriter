# Chapter 9: The Warrior’s Watch

The reception chamber retained its water-stained grandeur, yet the air had shifted. Three months since Queen Iolara’s pyre, the weight of her displeasure was gone, replaced by a watchful, brittle tension. Near an alcove carved with faded *neph*-vines, Rin Tarthan sipped water, her gaze methodical. Silks still rustled, jewels caught light from alabaster windows, but conversations died quickly, laughter felt strained. Even the intricate water channels crisscrossing the floor – flowing cleaner now, a tangible benefit of Princess Naimente’s decrees – reflected nervous faces alongside the marble. Prince Aethen, Rin noted, remained unseen, perhaps eclipsed by his sister’s ascendant influence.

Her eyes found the Allemarean officers. General Maran, flushed, held court near Lord Vaendae, whose tight jaw and sharp glances towards Captain Perrin betrayed his resentment over curtailed water privileges. Perrin herself stood apart, the Palace Guard captain’s posture rigid, face impassive – Naimente’s chosen instrument. The newer cut of her uniform, the sharper discipline in the flanking guards spoke of an efficiency replacing the old laxity. Commendable, Rin thought, a flicker of professional respect quickly overshadowed by unease. Worrying.

“Trade Princess Eilene,” Rin acknowledged as the Arnekol merchant paused nearby, crisp calculation softened by faint satisfaction.

“Commander Tarthan.” Eilene’s grey-blue eyes were assessing. “Allemarea adapts. One hopes for continued stability.” Her gaze flickered towards Perrin. Stability – Arnekol’s currency. Rin merely nodded.

An Allemarean colonel, smelling faintly of wine, approached, his steps slightly unsteady. “Commander. Tarthenia finds our hospitality agreeable? Much has… settled… since the unfortunate incident.”

“Allemarea extends courtesies,” Rin replied evenly. The man’s eyes held a flicker of something beyond politesse – fear. “Stability requires vigilance.”

The colonel paled visibly, glancing towards Perrin before taking a hasty gulp of wine. “Indeed. Her Highness demands no less. Discipline improves daily.”

Discipline hammered in by fear. Naimente’s influence ran deeper than clear water; it reshaped the court’s sinews. Rin thought of Lyam, her cousin, held somewhere in this gilded fortress. *Discipline. Vigilance.* The words tasted bitter.

Morning found Rin in the palace training yards, drawn by the instinct to assess tangible power – steel, muscle, skill. Cool light bathed the yard, dust rising from pounded earth. The clash of practice swords, sharp commands, grunts of exertion – sounds familiar as her own heartbeat.

From beneath a stone archway, she watched unnoticed. These were not the lax guardsmen she’d first seen. Movements were sharp, stances low, drills executed with grim precision born of relentless practice. Captain Perrin oversaw shield wall formations – effective for defence, yes, but chillingly suited for pushing through resistance, for controlling crowds.

Uniformity marked their equipment: standardized short swords, gleaming chainmail under tabards bearing the Princess’s blue alongside the King’s crest, sturdy round shields. Naimente’s reforms reached the armouries, resources efficiently applied.

Perrin’s voice cut through the din. “Again! Close ranks! Mind the flanks!” Her eyes missed nothing.

Rin stepped forward. “Captain Perrin.”

Perrin turned, surprise flickering before her face settled into stern neutrality. “Commander Tarthan.”

“Observing your methods.” Rin’s gaze swept the disciplined soldiers. “Impressive readiness.” Professional respect wrestled with a knot of apprehension in her gut.

“Princess Naimente requires diligence,” Perrin stated flatly. “Allemarea faces uncertain times. We must be prepared.”

“Prepared for what?” Rin kept her tone level.

Perrin met her gaze directly. “For any threat to the kingdom’s stability.” The unspoken targets hung heavy: internal threats, unrest, opposition. “Internal or external.” These soldiers trained not just for borders, but for enforcing the Princess’s will within Allemarea.

“Your drills focus heavily on close-quarter formations,” Rin observed, gesturing towards the shield wall. “Effective for urban pacification.”

A muscle twitched in Perrin’s jaw. “We train for all contingencies, Commander.” Her voice remained flat, but Rin saw the conviction behind the mask. Perrin believed in Naimente’s necessity, in the righteousness of this hardening grip.

“Indeed.” Rin offered a curt nod and turned away, the rhythmic clang of steel pursuing her. Allemarea’s fist was being reforged – sharper, harder, directed inward. The warrior in her noted the efficiency; the Tarthenian envoy felt a cold dread.

Lyam Tarthan’s quarters were opulent: draped silks, gleaming furniture, untouched fruit in silver bowls. Sunlight streamed through tall, barred windows overlooking a manicured courtyard. A gilded cage.

He rose as Rin entered, escorted by two impassive guards who remained inside the doorway. Dressed in fine Allemarean silks, he was paler, thinner. His smile was too bright, too quick.

“Rin! Cousin! A welcome sight.” His voice strained for lightness.

“Lyam.” Rin kept her voice steady, noting the tremor in his hand as he gestured towards a chair. “You appear… comfortable.”

“They treat me well,” he assured her, eyes flicking towards the guards. “The finest things…” He picked up a small, dark wood carving – a wolf, intricately detailed. “I’ve even taken up carving again.” His fingers tightened, knuckles white.

Rin recognized the style from childhood hours spent whittling. His usually steady hands fumbled. “Your skill remains.”

“One tries.” He forced another smile. “Father? Mother?”

“Well. They await your return.” Silence stretched.

One guard cleared his throat. “Commander, your time is limited.” Polite tone, absolute threat.

Lyam’s gaze met Rin’s. For an instant, the mask shattered. Raw terror pleaded from his eyes. Then, gone. “Of course. Duty calls. Give them… my love, Rin. Tell them I am well cared for.”

Cold fury tightened Rin’s gut, heating her face. Her hand instinctively twitched, an urge so strong it took conscious effort to keep her arms loose, her expression placid. A reckless act wouldn’t help Lyam. Tarthenia needed her assessment, Lyam needed her strategic.

She rose, placing a hand briefly on his shoulder, conveying what words could not. *Courage. Patience. I see.* “I will convey your greetings, Lyam. Stay well.”

He nodded, turning back to the carving as if it were a lifeline.

Walking away, flanked by the guards, Rin felt detachment burn away. Lyam’s terror, the casual cruelty – this was personal. Naimente’s rule might bring order, but it rested on calculated brutality. Not stability, but tyranny cloaked in efficiency.

Her resolve hardened. Observation was no longer enough. Communication with Tarthenia must intensify. Recalling Naevin’s missing histories, Eilene’s tallies of diverted iron – hesitant alliance with the scholar and merchant became necessary. The warrior’s watch was ending. The time to act approached.
