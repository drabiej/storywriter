# Chapter 21: The Waterspeaker

The Archives of Kor were less building than mountain hollow, carved tiers descending into Tarthenian rock a hard day’s ride from Greyfang Hold. Strata of accumulated knowledge plunged deeper, older, the air thickening with decaying parchment and geological time. Sparse lamplight battled shadows ancient as the stone. Naevin Daecilrith moved through the hush, robes whispering, flanked by Dmar Kasalkath’s rhythmic tread—the warrior favoring his left side slightly since their escape from Allemarea.

Months had passed since Arnekol’s smoke stained the horizon. Months wrestling strategy in Tarthenia’s martial halls, punctuated by Naevin’s dives into Kor’s memory-hoards. He sought not solace, but pattern—some frame for the encroaching madness, guided by his sister Elara’s ghost. Her last letter echoed: *unusual marginalia… drought precedents… Water Treaties Compendium…* A Compendium now conveniently vanished from Allemarea.

“Further down, Scholar,” rasped a voice thin as papyrus. Archivist Maelor materialized from the gloom, blind eyes milky voids. Impossibly old, navigating by memory and air currents, his ink-stained skeletal fingers beckoned. “The strata you seek… seldom consulted. Unfashionable truths.”

He led them deeper, past groaning shelves of catalogued histories and forgotten sciences. Dmar’s pragmatic presence felt stark against the ethereal Archivist and the weight of lore. The pressure of recorded existence felt immense.

Maelor stopped before an alcove sealed with treated hide marked by archaic glyphs. “The Fifth Repository. Records deemed… volatile. Cycles. Collapses.” Ancient leather creaked as he worked the fastenings. “Knowledge is a current, Scholar. Some pull towards the abyss.”

Inside, tomb-cold air hung thick with dust. Scrolls lay in disarray, some cracked, some bearing scorch marks inconsistent with neglect. Maelor guided Naevin’s hand towards soot-edged cylinders.

“*Fragments of the Sundered Age*,” Maelor breathed. “Before the Ruinekarian ascendancy. Difficult. Contradictory.”

Naevin carefully unrolled a brittle scroll. The pre-classical Kor script was dense with unfamiliar elemental terms. He scanned, piecing fragments: societal collapse, droughts mirroring Allemarea’s records, then more. *‘…the Scouring Flame contested the Quenching Flood… heavens wept ash… earth drank bitterness…’* Another spoke of *‘…Tarashren’s heart consuming fields… Daecillaea’s sorrow drowning valleys…’* Was *this* Elara’s ‘unusual marginalia’? Not just drought notes, but hints of something older woven within?

The names struck him like ice. Tarashren. Daecillaea. Furies of Allemarean folklore, dismissed as superstition. Here, treated not as myth, but as forces. Recurring phenomena. He found references to power lines, geographical nexuses linked to water sources – great waterfalls, hidden springs – places of *‘elemental confluence’*. A chilling resonance with Allemarea’s reliance on its Great Falls.

“Dmar,” Naevin murmured, voice tight. “*‘…the Flame’s influence waxes when the waters wane… seeks the dry heart… consumes from within…’*” It echoed Arnekol – fire leaping canals, burning unnaturally. Naimente. Consuming from within.

Dmar peered closer, frowning. “Legends, Scholar. Poetry for bad harvests and war.”

“Perhaps,” Naevin conceded, but his skin prickled. The patterns felt too precise. He found another fragment mentioning shrines near these nexuses, for appeasing or channeling the ‘essences’. Appeasing Tarashren? Channeling Daecillaea? “Maelor, these ‘confluences’… were they mapped?”

Maelor’s sightless gaze seemed distant. “Maps are fragile. Rivers change course. Knowledge drowns.” He gestured vaguely. “Seek the living water. Sometimes echoes linger where the stone drinks deep.” He turned, melting back into the gloom, leaving Naevin amidst fragments of catastrophe, skepticism warring with visceral dread.

Later, needing air free of dust and foreboding, Naevin climbed towards Kor’s upper tiers. Drawn by the half-remembered sound of falling water, he found the Shrine of Whispering Falls tucked into a cliff cleft. Smaller than Allemarea’s grand source, yet undeniably ancient. Water cascaded down moss-slick rock into a deep pool, spray cool on his face. Worn steps led down, flanked by weathered carvings. Faint spirals, the Ruinekarian glyph for *Daecil* – water – intertwined with a symbol of depth or binding he couldn’t place. The same script hinted at beneath Allemarea’s overlays.

He stood near the pool, the roar filling his ears. Closing his eyes, trying to order the fragments, the sound seemed to deepen, resonating in his bones. A profound cold radiated from the water, far colder than the spray. He felt… a presence. Immense, ancient, indifferent as the crushing sea. Unbidden images flooded his mind: ice spreading, water blackening under a dying sun, a single blue eye weeping glaciers. *Daecillaea’s sorrow?* He staggered back, gasping, heart pounding. Hallucination? Or Maelor’s ‘echoes’?

“The falls speak differently to those who listen.”

Naevin spun. A quiet figure stood near the entrance, robed in grey, face weathered. The shrine keeper.

“Forgive me,” Naevin stammered. “The sound… the cold…”

The keeper nodded slowly. “It has layers. Most hear water. Some… hear the depths.” He glanced at the carvings. “Old stones. Placed when the world was younger.”

“These carvings,” Naevin began, pointing towards the intertwined symbols, “Do they relate to… connections? Between places like this?”

The keeper considered. “The old lore speaks of lines connecting such places. Threads of water-wisdom, deep beneath the earth.” He shrugged. “Veins of the world, carrying its pulse. Scholars scoff now. But the stones remember. The water still flows.” He turned back towards the shrine’s shadowed interior.

The cold faded, but a chilling hypothesis formed in its place. Naevin lingered a moment, the roar of the falls seeming both simpler and infinitely more complex. Then, resolve hardening, he turned away. He had to convince them.

* * *

The War Room in Greyfang Hold felt stark. Tarthenian steel gleamed dully. Maps lay under lantern light. Rin Tarthan stood rigid, grief a banked fire, hand near a hidden hilt. Eilene Anaedrui, bandaged hand resting on the table, radiated cold focus. Dmar stood near Naevin, a solid presence. Tarthenian commanders watched, faces set.

Naevin took a breath, beeswax sharp against the memory of dust and icy water. He laid out his findings – the Sundered Age fragments, Tarashren and Daecillaea as forces, the missing records, Arnekol’s unnatural burning. He spoke of the shrine connections, the lore of water-lines, struggling to bridge reason and the inexplicable.

“The patterns are undeniable,” he argued, voice tight. “Cyclical conflict, linked to these elemental forces. Naimente’s rise, her methods… they align with descriptions of ‘Tarashren’s influence’ waxing when water wanes.”

He paused, meeting their eyes. “But the lore speaks of a counterforce. Daecillaea. Water. Linked to nexuses – great waterfalls. Like Allemarea’s.” He described his experience at the Kor falls. “I felt… a connection. A vast cold. I believe Allemarea’s Great Falls are more than just their water source. They are a nexus. A lynchpin. Perhaps the very focus of Naimente’s power – or whatever force drives her.”

Silence fell, thick with disbelief and desperation. A grizzled commander shifted, jaw tight.

“A strategy, Scholar?” Rin asked finally, voice flat. The word ‘strategy’ sounded brittle against the memory of Lyam.

Naevin nodded, moving to the map of Allemarea. “A gamble. Based on fragmented lore and… what I experienced.” He hesitated. “Instead of a direct assault, we target the source. The Great Falls themselves. If the legends hold true, if these places are connected, disrupting that nexus might disrupt *her*. Counter the fire.”

Eilene frowned, calculating. Her gaze flicked towards Arnekol’s scorched absence on the map. “Risk? High. Unknowns? Numerous. Potential gain?”

“Decisive, possibly,” Naevin admitted. “Or catastrophic. But facing her fire directly…” He gestured again at the void where Arnekol had been. “That seems equally perilous.”

Rin’s gaze sharpened, a flicker of grim interest—or cold necessity. Any path to Naimente. Dmar subtly leaned closer to the map, tracing a potential route towards the Falls with a gloved finger, his earlier skepticism replaced by tactical assessment. The Tarthenian commanders exchanged uneasy glances, caught between the calculus of war and the chilling possibility offered by the scholar. They listened, knowing they might not just fight a tyrant, but an ancient, cyclical fire.
