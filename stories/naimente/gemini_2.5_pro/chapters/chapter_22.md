# Chapter 22: Voices in the Deep

Dawn broke thin and bruised over Allemarea, grey light filtering through the high palace windows. Aethen moved through the sleeping corridors, the silence heavier than stone, punctuated only by the distant tread of unseen boots—Perrin’s guards, Naimente’s ears. Grief was a constant chill, the lingering ghost of his parents, of Arnekol’s unnatural pyres, of the hope he and Naimente had shared, now ash. He walked as a puppet king, his love the strings binding him to the darkness consuming his kingdom’s heart.

He sought the path to the Source, the shrine housing the headwaters of the Great Falls. He needed air free of the palace’s miasma, the solace of the sacred waters. Yet, even from afar, a wrongness radiated from the hallowed space, a chill deeper than the morning air.

The roar was muted. Standing on worn flagstones before the cascade, Aethen heard not the thunder that had defined Allemarea for millennia, but a strained rasp. The torrent plunging into the chasm was diminished, revealing more dark, weeping stone than he had ever seen. Mosses, once impossibly emerald, clung brown and withered. Sacred *ivera* ferns drooped, edged with decay. The air felt stagnant, the water’s ancient song discordant.

He knelt by the pool, the water cool but strangely lifeless against his fingers. He remembered childhood visits – the overwhelming power, the vibration through the stone, life pouring from the world’s heart. Now… it felt tired. Sick. Wounded, like the kingdom itself.

Was this Naimente’s doing? Had her tightening grip poisoned the Source? Or was it the land reflecting the sickness within its rulers? He thought of Arnekol’s fires, leaping water, burning violet and green. *Fire consuming water.* Old tales felt chillingly relevant. Allemarea faded like the falls, like the light in Naimente’s eyes, replaced by that cold fire. His passive horror was not enough. He dipped his hand again, the lifeless water shocking his skin. *Enough.* The thought cut through grief. He pushed himself up, stone unforgiving beneath his knees. He would act.

The path forward, dangerous but clear, formed in his mind. His studio, his art – they would carry the warning. He turned from the dying falls, steps quickening towards the palace wing where Kael awaited.

Sunlight streamed into his studio, illuminating dust motes dancing around paper sculptures – cranes in flight, villages unfolding, figures caught in quiet dignity. Remnants of a time hope felt tangible. Newer pieces lurked in corners: a twisted tree of dark paper, roots like claws; a fountain choked with sharp shards. The charcoal seemed to draw the unease directly from him, forming twisted shapes on the vellum.

He worked now not on sculpture, but a sketch: a landscape study of the Serpent’s Spine peaks. Beside him, Kael, a young court artist with honest eyes, ground lapis lazuli, voice low.

“The composition, Your Majesty,” Kael murmured. “Careful balance is needed. Too much shadow near the Western Ridge…” He tapped the sketch. “…obscures the passes. Traditionally, it might suggest… ambush?”

Aethen nodded. *Western Ridge… passes… ambush.* Intelligence from Eilene’s network before Arnekol burned. Naimente planned to send troops through those passes, flanking the Tarthenians. “The light is harsh there, Kael,” Aethen replied, adding a grey chalk wash, subtly altering the perspective in their pre-arranged code. “Perhaps softer rendering suggests clearer passage? Less dramatic contrast.” He shifted a mark near a specific peak – confirming the intel.

Kael studied the change. “A delicate adjustment, Majesty. Evokes… openness.” He began grinding ochre. “And the foothills? Earth tones, but perhaps a sequence… signifying movement? Supplies from the south?”

“Precisely,” Aethen confirmed, selecting chalks coded to troop numbers and supplies. “Let the progression suggest a steady flow.” He layered colours into the foothills, embedding warnings Naimente’s censors would miss within the art. The sketch, ostensibly for a defunct Tarthenian cultural exchange, was now a fragile weapon.

“Ready for the courier by evening, Majesty,” Kael confirmed, meeting Aethen’s gaze for a fleeting instant – shared purpose flashing before he looked down, a young man risking everything. Gratitude warred with fear in Aethen’s chest. Another soul caught in the web.

Night fell starless. Aethen waited in their chambers, the opulent space cold, alien. Silk hangings absorbed the lamplight. He stood near the window, gazing at the distant city lights, ignorant of the rot spreading from the palace. He heard her approach – the rustle of silk, the deliberate confidence in her step.

Naimente entered, pausing. Her presence filled the room. Lines of weariness marked her face, yet the unsettling fire in her eyes burned brighter.

“Aethen.” Her voice was softer than it had been in weeks. “You wished to speak?”

He turned, heart pounding. Love, grief, horror, resolve. “Naimente. We must.”

She observed him, gaze sharp. “You seem troubled.”

“Troubled?” The word felt hollow. “Allemarea bleeds. Arnekol is ash – unnatural ash. Lyam Tarthan executed. Perrin’s shadow everywhere, fear chokes every whisper. The Falls…” He gestured vaguely, helplessly. “They diminish. And you ask if I am troubled?”

Her expression tightened. “Regrettable necessities. Arnekol conspired. Lyam’s family committed treason. Perrin maintains order. The Falls… nature is cyclical.” Cold calculations.

“Do not,” Aethen’s voice roughened, “insult me with these justifications. I know the reports Perrin feeds you. I know Arnekol burned with more than spite. I know you strip Allemarea bare for a war built on lies.” He stepped closer, anger eclipsing fear. “I see the pattern. My mother. My father. Anyone who questioned. Removed.”

Naimente stiffened, eyes narrowing. “You tread dangerous ground.”

“Do I?” He held her gaze, seeing not the healer he loved, but a stranger. “I am King of Allemarea. And I see my kingdom corrupted, my people afraid, my wife transformed into… this.”

“This path leads only to ruin,” he pleaded, desperation raw in his voice. One last appeal. “Turn back. For Allemarea’s sake. For who you were… stop.”

She stared, silent, the fire in her eyes intensifying, burning away shared history. He saw the calculation click. He saw himself assessed – not as husband, but as obstacle. Weakness. Threat.

“Sentiment changes nothing, Aethen,” she said finally, her voice flat, devoid of warmth. “The Tarthenians won't pause their armies for troubled waters or a grieving king. Allemarea requires strength.” She turned away, dismissing him, dismissing his plea. Dismissing *him*. “The war proceeds. My course is set. Do not interfere.”

He watched her go, her words settling like ice. The healer was gone. The connection severed. He had spoken truth, asserted conscience, and known, with chilling certainty, he had signed his own death warrant. The voices in the deep had spoken; Naimente, deafened by her own fire, refused to listen. He was now merely another regrettable necessity on her path.
