# Chapter 23

The air in the War Council Chamber felt brittle. Maps detailed the lands around Allemarea: the threatening Serpent’s Spine peaks west, the Rin valley scarred by Arnekol’s absence. Blue markers showed the encroaching alliance. *Vengeful Tarthenians,* Naimente thought grimly. *Kor engineers—Naevin's hand—and Arnekol's survivors under Eilene...* A viper's nest she'd stirred.

She stood at the table's head, Aethen’s vacant chair a silent rebuke beside her. Lamplight sharpened her features, the intensity in her violet eyes. She scanned the commanders, the cowed nobles like Vaendae, their fear palpable. Captain Perrin stood near the door, loyalty personified.

“The enemy converges,” Naimente began, her voice cutting the silence, calm and precise. “Tarthenian raiders hit our patrols. Kor engineers reinforce their lines. Arnekol’s refugees hunger for revenge.” She tapped the map where the alliance pressed closest. “They think us weak, divided. They expect a siege.”

General Maran stared at the enemy red markers. “Highness, our defenses are strong, but their numbers…”

“Numbers mean little if their supply lines fail,” Naimente countered smoothly. “If the land turns against them.” Her gaze swept the council. “We won’t wait behind walls. We deny them sustenance. We bleed them before they reach our gates.”

She traced a finger across the fertile lands bordering Allemarea’s core territories. “Every field, every mill, every storehouse that could feed them must be rendered useless. Torched. Salted. Wells poisoned.”

A collective gasp. Maran paled. “Highness… scorched earth? Our lands? Our *people* live there!”

“They chose their loyalties by remaining,” Naimente stated, voice chillingly devoid of empathy. “Their sacrifice is necessary. Survival demands we deny the enemy purchase. Allemarea’s heartland must be protected, even if the extremities must be… cauterized.” The word echoed Arnekol’s fate.

Lord Vaendae flinched, horrified protest swiftly suppressed. He remembered the plaza executions.

“It is harsh, Highness,” Maran persisted, voice strained. “The cost…”

“The cost of failure is annihilation, General,” Naimente snapped, silencing him. “They seek to extinguish Allemarea. We meet malice with resolve. Implement the order. Sweep the zones. Leave *nothing*.” She turned from the map, the familiar cold fire pulsing within—the same heat felt before ancient stones, the certainty that justified Arnekol’s burning. A righteous furnace consuming doubt. Purification required sacrifice. Dismissing them, Naimente sought the cold solitude of her chambers, leaving the council trapped between fear of the enemy and fear of her.

Later, the Royal Chambers felt cavernous. Moonlight bleached the tapestries, highlighting dust on Aethen’s untouched paper sculptures. The water channel’s muted flow seemed weaker, like the kingdom’s pulse. She heard Aethen enter, his steps hesitant.

He stopped feet away, his face tight with anguish and resolve. “Naimente.”

She turned slowly. “Aethen.”

“The orders,” he said, voice hoarse. “Scorched earth. Our fields. Our villages.” His eyes pleaded for denial. “This isn’t defense. It’s monstrous.”

“It’s strategy, Aethen,” she replied flatly. “Denying them resources.”

“Resources?” He stepped closer, voice cracking. “You mean lives! Homes! The people we swore to protect!” His hands clenched. “Wasn't Arnekol enough? The executions? Lyam? *Even the Falls diminish!*” Grief warred with fury. “Where does it end?”

“It ends when Allemarea is secure,” she countered, impatient with his sentimentality, a weakness she couldn't afford.

“Secure?” he cried, the word shattering. “Or desolate? Ruled by fear and ash? This isn't the kingdom we dreamed of! This isn't the woman I loved!” The pain struck her, yet solidified her resolve. Love was vulnerability. Dreams were for peacetime.

“That woman was naive,” Naimente said, voice cold as river stone. “She didn’t understand the necessities of power. The sacrifices.”

“Sacrifices?” Aethen stared, horror dawning, seeing the abyss between them. “Or monstrosities justified by ambition?” He took a shaky breath, clarity hardening his features. *My warnings… useless. I have no choice left.* Shoulders squared, the artist yielded to the King. “I cannot stand by. If you proceed with this madness… I will speak out. To the court, the army, the people. I will denounce these orders. I will expose what you have become.”

The threat hung, final. *Public denouncement. By the King.* The thought struck cold. *He knows too much—Lyam, Arnekol's ashes. He'd rally dissenters. Undermine everything.* A threat. Unacceptable. He left her no choice. A liability founded on dangerous knowledge.

Naimente held his gaze, the last flicker of shared history extinguished. Pity mingled briefly with calculation. A regrettable necessity.

“You believe you could stop me?” she asked quietly.

His eyes held defiant sorrow. “I must try.”

She turned away, facing the moonlit window, severing the final connection. “Your conscience does you credit, Aethen,” she said, voice chillingly detached. “But it will be your undoing.” She heard his sharp intake of breath, felt his devastation, yet remained unmoved. Another obstacle to be removed. For Allemarea. For the vision only she could realize.

Later, in a small, guarded study, Naimente met Perrin and two loyal lieutenants. Battle maps lay spread.

“The King,” Naimente began, voice low, tracing a finger across the battle lines, “is consumed by grief, yet insists on riding out with the honor guard. To inspire the troops.” She met Perrin’s unwavering gaze. “His courage is commendable. But reckless.”

Perrin nodded slowly, understanding dawning. “The battle will be chaotic, Highness. Fog of war.”

“Precisely,” Naimente confirmed. “A hero’s death. Leading a valiant, perhaps ill-advised, charge. A symbol. A martyr for Allemarea.” She outlined the specifics – timing, positioning, the ‘confusion’ leaving Aethen isolated, the loyalists ensuring the narrative. His death: tragic, inspiring. A tool.

“His sacrifice,” she concluded flatly, “must galvanize our forces. Ensure the story is crafted, disseminated immediately. Grief turned to righteous fury.”

Perrin absorbed the instructions, expressionless. “It will appear seamless, Highness. A tragic loss. A rallying cry.”

“See that it does, Captain.” Naimente met Perrin's gaze. "And afterwards... identify any close confidants of the King. Those he might have spoken to about his reservations. Loose threads must be tied. Discreetly." *Like Kael,* Naimente thought fleetingly. No conflicting narratives.

Perrin gave a curt nod. "No loose threads, Highness."

Naimente dismissed them. Alone, the plan settled, cold and perfect. She felt nothing. No grief, no remorse. Only the chilling certainty of necessity. Aethen’s love, once a foundation, then a complication, now a threat. It had to be excised. She moved to the window, looking into the darkness. The final obstacle would be removed. Only the consuming fire remained.
