# Chapter 6: A Thousand Ripples

Three months since the Queen’s pyre turned to ash, three months since the tremor of that final confrontation settled into the official story of tragic accident. Whispers persisted, but the narrative held. The King, mending slowly from his wife’s poisons but shattered by her end, retreated into grief, leaving rule increasingly to his son and new daughter-by-law. Summer ripened in Allemarea, promising bounty, and today, its warmth felt like vindication.

Naimente stood on the Sunken Plaza dais, Aethen beside her, his hand resting lightly on her back. Below, a sea of upturned faces reflected the midday sun. Common folk – artisans, merchants, labourers, farmers – their garments less threadbare, their faces holding not dull resignation, but a fragile, burgeoning hope aimed squarely at her.

The plaza's heart, long choked with refuse, showed renewed life. Restored main channels, meticulously cleaned under Torwen the Rainkeeper’s supervision, now carried clearer water from the high reservoirs, guided by the schedules Naimente had devised and enforced. The water glittered, its murmur a soothing counterpoint to the crowd’s expectant silence, beginning to feed secondary channels towards districts starved for decades. A thousand nascent ripples.

Aethen squeezed her arm gently, his smile shadowed beneath, before stepping back. Minister Therin, his voice steadier now, perhaps having chosen his side in the court’s quiet realignment, completed his preamble. “…presenting Her Highness, Princess Naimente Aeldae, whose wisdom brings renewed flow to the lifeblood of our city.”

Polite applause swelled into heartfelt cheers. *Naimente! Naimente!* The sound washed over her, warmer than the Queen’s chill pronouncements. Real. Hard-won. She stepped forward, a silver circlet catching the light, her gown the blue of deep water. The hidden healer’s pouch was a familiar weight against her hip.

“People of Allemarea!” Her voice carried, clear and steady. Not a shout, but focused intensity. “We gather today not merely for water, but to affirm a truth: the blessings of this kingdom belong to all its people.”

A roar of assent. She let it subside, gaze sweeping the crowd, meeting eyes. She noted, peripherally, the scholar Naevin’s unreadable focus near a pillar, the Tarthenian Rin’s watchful stillness – scrutiny beyond the adoration.

“For too long,” she continued, “the channels were narrowed, the flow diverted by neglect and greed. Fields thirsted while fountains played for the few. Neighbours fought over dwindling drops. That era ends.”

She gestured towards the flowing water. “*Daecil ar Korlith*. Water and Trust. These guide us. The water flows because trust is being rebuilt. Trust that resources will be shared. Trust that governance serves the governed. Trust that your needs are heard.” She thought of Kevan’s plea, Lyra’s fading breath – the cold helplessness that had no place here, now.

“This is a beginning,” she declared, voice hardening slightly. “Restoring these channels required immense effort, challenging old ways. Further progress demands the same. Some cling to shadows, resenting the light. But Allemarea’s strength lies not in hoarding, but in circulation. Like healthy blood, prosperity must reach every part to sustain the whole.”

She raised her hands. “Let this water be a promise. Of fairness, of diligence, of a kingdom renewed. *Korle, ea Daecil.* Truth and Water. May they flow together, nourishing us all.”

The cheering surged, unrestrained. Aethen stepped beside her, pride clear, though his smile seemed tight. "They see the hope, Naimente." A genuine warmth spread through her, eclipsing, for a moment, the lingering inner chill. This feeling, this sight – it *was* the justification.

Later, in the Water Guild’s council room – smelling of damp stone and oiled mechanisms – the mood was focused. Maps detailed Allemarea’s water systems, marked with Naimente’s revisions and Torwen’s annotations. The Rainkeeper, face weathered as old rock, nodded slowly.

“Flow rates hold steady in the main arteries, Highness,” he confirmed, voice rough. “Pressure is good, reaching designated outer districts. Reservoir levels managed. Phase one works.” Beside him, guild heads murmured agreement.

“Excellent work, Torwen. To all of you,” Naimente acknowledged, shifting from pronouncement to command. “The city is grateful. But implementation is only the first step.”

“Aye, Highness. And there lies the rub,” said Borin, the stout Mason’s Guild master. “Lord Vaendae’s men dammed the Millrace feeder channel again last night. Claimed rights dating back three reigns.”

Naimente’s jaw tightened. Vaendae. Clinging to privilege, defying the new ordinances. The same lord Kevan had accused. “His claim is baseless. That channel feeds three downstream villages, Silverstream included, and the miller.”

“We cleared it this dawn, Highness,” Torwen stated flatly. “But his steward swore they’d rebuild. Muttered about tradition.”

Impatient heat flared in Naimente. Tradition. The shield for stagnation, for suffering. “Tradition grants no right to cause thirst,” she said, voice dangerously quiet. “Document this. Send word to Captain Perrin. Have Vaendae’s steward brought for questioning. Double the guild patrols along that section. Ensure the water flows.”

The guild masters exchanged glances – a direct challenge to a powerful noble – but saw her resolve. Torwen gave a curt nod. “As you command.”

Naimente reviewed reports, approved repairs, her mind sharp, cutting through obfuscation. The work felt clean, necessary – healing on a grand scale. Against this tangible progress, Vaendae's resistance felt like… a sickness. A chill clarity settled over her, pushing sentiment aside. Sickness needed excision. For the greater good.

Night found her in their private garden. Moonlight cast long shadows among iverwood benches and whispering aivle-blossoms. The garden channel’s murmur seemed louder tonight. Aethen sat beside her, holding her hand, his warmth a buffer against the cool air.

“You were magnificent,” he said softly, thumb tracing patterns on her skin. “They see the hope.” A faint weariness lined his voice.

She leaned against him, accepting the comfort, though part of her felt distant. “It felt right, Aethen. Seeing the water flow. Their faces.”

“It *is* right.” He hesitated. “You seem burdened. The nightmares…?”

She stiffened. The Queen’s face, contorted. The crack of bone. Blood. *Sometimes you recall the shock, the fear, just before she fell.* The memory surfaced less often, blurred by duty, but left her breathless, cold. “They fade,” she lied, or perhaps wished. “The resistance takes its toll.”

“Vaendae again?” he guessed, jaw tight.

She nodded. “He obstructs the water. Clings to privilege while others suffer. How can they not see the necessity?” Impatience roughened her voice.

Aethen sighed. “Entitlement isn’t easily relinquished. And… shadows linger after storms, Naimente.” His gaze seemed distant, perhaps reflecting on his own storm. He drew her closer. “But your reforms are just. Your resolve is strong. Don’t let their shadows dim your light.” He paused, his eyes holding hers. “Or ours. Remember the good you do. That’s your strength.”

She clung to his words. *The good I do.* The shield against the chill, the justification that quieted echoes of that night. The Queen had been poison. Removing her, even by accident born of desperation, allowed this healing. A necessary, terrible remedy. Cold resolve settled within her, yet beneath it stirred a faint, dangerous heat – a sense such remedies might be needed again. She had acted to protect the King, Aethen, these very reforms. It had to be so.

She turned, silencing his concern with a kiss, seeking refuge in his warmth, his belief in her. His love was an anchor, but the water whispered secrets only she heard, echoes from colder currents. She pushed the thought away, focusing on Aethen, on the undeniable good rippling outwards. The cost, she told herself fiercely, was justified by the cure. She would not falter. She would heal this kingdom, no matter the price.
