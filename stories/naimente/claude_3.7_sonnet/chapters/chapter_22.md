# Chapter 22: Voices in the Deep

Dawn had not yet broken when Aethen Aeldae rose from his chamber. Sleep had eluded him these past nights, chased away by troubled dreams of blue fire consuming stone as easily as flesh. He dressed without servants, selecting simple garments devoid of royal insignia. In darkness, he could almost pretend he was still the thoughtful prince who had once wandered northern villages, before a hunting injury had placed him in the care of a violet-eyed healer.

The palace corridors stretched empty before him, guards standing like statues at their posts—the Security Enhancement Division's men now, not the traditional Royal Guard. Aethen nodded as he passed, noticing how Captain Perrin's eyes briefly met his before looking away. Unlike the others whose mechanical acknowledgments felt more like surveillance than protection, her gaze held a flicker of something else—the same hesitation he had observed during Lord Vaendae's execution three weeks ago.

He took a seldom-used stairway that wound downward through the heart of the palace, emerging into a narrow passage that led toward the waterfall shrine. The path showed signs of neglect—moss creeping across stone steps, ceremonial lanterns unlit, water channels running sluggish and clouded.

The shrine itself had been carved directly into the cliff face behind Allemarea's great waterfall. In better days, royal worship had been conducted beneath the thunderous deluge, water's sacred voice drowning out all worldly concerns. This morning, the falls had diminished to little more than an anemic trickle.

"*Daecil aern korvin*," he whispered, performing the ancient blessing. The words echoed against damp stone walls adorned with carvings depicting the balance between water and fire—Daecillaea and Tarashren, ancient forces now forgotten by most.

Aethen approached the ceremonial basin carved from blue-veined stone at the shrine's center. Where once clear mountain water had flowed in abundance, now only a shallow puddle remained, its surface bearing an oily film that caught the light. He dipped his fingers into the liquid, finding it tepid and viscous.

"Even here," he murmured. "Even at the source."

The contradiction troubled him deeply—redistribution should not affect the source itself, only the channels flowing from it. Something more fundamental was changing beneath Allemarea's surface.

As he performed the water blessing, memories surged unbidden. Naimente kneeling beside him during his fever, her hands cool against his burning skin. Naimente before the Execution Plaza, her eyes gleaming with that strange inner light as she ordered Lord Vaendae's death. It had been a gradual change, accelerating after the assassination attempt six weeks ago. That blade across her ribs had marked a turning point—as though the wound had opened a channel through which something else flowed into her. Their midnight conversation in her garden just before the attack—when he had nearly convinced her to reconsider the executions—now seemed like the last glimpse of the woman he had once loved.

A soft sound broke his reverie. Aethen turned, hand instinctively reaching for the slender dagger concealed within his sleeve.

"Peace, Your Majesty," came a familiar voice. "It is only Mereth."

The court artist emerged from shadow, his slender frame bent slightly with age. Paint stained his fingers, and charcoal dust smudged his cheeks.

"*Daecil aern korvin*," Mereth offered, completing the traditional blessing.

"You risk much coming here," Aethen said, glancing toward the passage behind them.

"A small matter of altered notations. Your morning devotions remain private."

In Mereth, he had found an unexpected ally—one whose artistic talents provided means of documentation beyond Naimente's surveillance.

"Walk with me," Aethen said, gesturing toward a narrow path that circled the shrine's perimeter. They moved in silence until reaching the outermost edge where water once cascaded in magnificent curtains.

"The eastern provinces report drought conditions," Mereth said without preamble. "Crops wither despite the canals running full. The water itself seems to provide less nourishment, as though its essential nature has changed."

"And the northern regions?"

"Similar reports. Plants require twice the normal water to maintain half their growth." Mereth withdrew a folded parchment from his sleeve. "From your friend in Kor."

Aethen accepted the missive with careful hands. "He used the water-soluble ink?"

"Indeed. Seventeen minutes of reading time once exposed to moisture." Mereth produced a small vial of clear liquid.

Aethen dampened the parchment, revealing Naevin's precise script:

*Water quality deterioration progresses at seventeen percent acceleration beyond previous measurement. Similar patterns preceded Ashanar's creation. The Broken Circle prepares implementation at source location during upcoming celestial alignment. Tarthenia reports increased military presence along northern borders—preparations appear offensive rather than defensive. Eilene survived Arnekol's destruction; her firsthand account confirms blue fire manifests what I must now acknowledge as Tarashren's elemental essence. The vessel—Naimente—bears Tarashren's influence in increasing measure since the assassination attempt. Source purification requires vessel with opposing essence—we seek one connected to Daecillaea.*

Aethen read quickly, committing details to memory before the script began fading. The reference to "experiences at Kor's water shrine" suggested a significant change in the scholar's thinking—the rational academic now accepting supernatural explanations he had long resisted.

"I've begun the documentation you requested," Mereth said as Aethen returned the dissolving parchment. "Though maintaining both accuracy and necessary discretion proves challenging."

"Show me."

They descended through forgotten passages, emerging eventually into Mereth's private chambers—a space filled with canvases, pigments, and the distinctive smell of linseed oil.

Mereth locked the door, then moved to an unassuming cabinet whose intricate woodwork concealed a false back. From within, he withdrew a canvas wrapped in plain linen.

"The requested documentation," he said, setting the painting upon an easel.

At first glance, it appeared a conventional court scene—Naimente presiding over council, nobles arranged in traditional formation. Yet as Aethen looked closer, he discerned the subtle encoding they had developed. Naimente's eyes contained a carefully rendered flame-like quality. The water channels showed minute particulates suggesting degradation. The nobles' positions and gestures communicated specific execution orders through a symbolic language only they shared.

"A faithful record," Aethen said softly. "Though one requiring particular interpretation."

"The companion pieces progress accordingly," Mereth indicated several additional canvases. "The Arnekol series proved most challenging, as I worked from secondhand accounts."

Each depicted a stage of Arnekol's destruction—the initial deployment of Allemarean forces, the specialized containers bearing blue fire, the merchant city consumed by unnatural flame. To uninformed observers, they would appear patriotic illustrations of a military victory. To those who knew the code, they documented atrocity with unflinching precision.

"And the paper sculptures?"

Mereth moved toward a work table where dozens of delicate figures stood. "Complete, though necessarily smaller than your own creations."

The paper sculptures had become their most secure communication method. Aethen's artistic hobby was well-known throughout the palace, his skill in crafting delicate representations of common people considered a charming royal eccentricity. None suspected that specific folds and positioning conveyed information Naimente's surveillance could not decode.

"These will be delivered to the usual locations?" Aethen asked, examining a particularly detailed figure representing a mother holding a sick child—its configurations communicating water quality deterioration in eastern provinces.

"Through established channels," Mereth confirmed. "The merchant caravans depart at midday."

Such careful resistance, conducted through artistic means that Naimente's militaristic mind would never comprehend. Yet Aethen wondered if their subtle opposition amounted to anything more than symbolic protest against an unstoppable force.

"There is more," Mereth said, lowering his voice. "Drana has returned from the eastern provinces."

Aethen's attention sharpened. Drana—Mereth's oldest daughter—had been dispatched weeks earlier to document conditions beyond the capital.

"And her observations?"

"Troubling beyond expectation." Mereth withdrew a small notebook from beneath floorboards. "The water quality deterioration accelerates. Livestock die despite abundant irrigation. Children develop what appears to be an evolved form of waterlung—the traditional respiratory symptoms now accompanied by blue-tinged extremities, increased body temperature, and crystalline formations within bodily fluids."

Aethen took the notebook, scanning Drana's precise documentation with growing horror. "These contradict everything in Naimente's official pronouncements."

"The eastern implementation she celebrates as triumph appears catastrophe when observed directly. Redistribution channels function mechanically while delivering water whose essential nature has transformed."

"Like poison flowing through veins," Aethen murmured. "The system intact while the substance corrupts."

As he continued reading, a guard's distant voice announced changing rotation—a reminder that even their careful seclusion could not last indefinitely.

"I must return before my absence raises concern," Aethen said. "I shall confront her directly."

Mereth's face betrayed rare alarm. "Such directness carries significant risk. Remember what happened to Lord Vaendae."

"Yet indirect resistance proves insufficient." Aethen's expression hardened. "I have watched and waited while she transformed from the woman I loved into something I scarcely recognize. If none stand openly against her, Allemarea itself may follow Arnekol into ash."

"The waters may carry away even the strongest swimmer when currents turn violent," Mereth cautioned.

"The waters find their path regardless of barriers," Aethen replied. "Sometimes one must become the stone that redirects the current, even knowing the water will eventually wear it away."

---

Midday light streamed through water-etched windows as Aethen reviewed the evidence assembled through their covert network—reports of water quality deterioration, testimonies from provincial administrators, records of military deployments that contradicted official explanations.

Most disturbing were the medical records obtained through Mereth's daughter. The symptoms appearing throughout eastern provinces bore troubling similarity to ancient descriptions of "water corruption" preceding Ashanar's creation. Blue-tinged extremities, elevated body temperature, crystalline formations within bodily fluids—all documented in historical texts as harbingers of environmental collapse.

A soft knock interrupted his review. Aethen quickly concealed the documents beneath innocuous administrative records before calling, "Enter."

A servant appeared, bowing. "Lady Naimente requests your presence in the council chamber, Your Majesty."

Once alone, he gathered several key documents that even Naimente could not dismiss—water quality assessments from her own Security Enhancement Division, medical reports bearing official seals, agricultural productivity metrics showing declining yield despite increased irrigation.

He paused before a small shrine in the corner of his study—a simple stone basin containing water from his northern hunting accident—the last untainted sample he possessed from the region where he had first met Naimente.

"*Daecil aern korvin*," he whispered. "May these waters restore that which time diminishes."

The council chamber hummed with subdued activity as Aethen entered. Naimente stood before the great map table, her violet robes catching light as she indicated positions to assembled commanders. The military focus of these deliberations—once concealed beneath administrative terminology—had become increasingly overt since Arnekol's destruction.

Conversation ceased at his appearance, commanders straightening with formal acknowledgment that contained neither genuine respect nor outright insubordination.

"Aethen," Naimente said, using his name without royal title. "The northern implementation proceeds according to timeline. Commander Telaren reports successful fortification along highland approaches."

He noted the distinctive flame-like quality in her eyes—that strange illumination that appeared during discussions of military matters or when her authority faced challenge. More concerning was her physical appearance. Though still beautiful, subtle changes had manifested: increased pallor despite heightened color in her cheeks, a feverish brightness to her gaze, faint blue tinge to her fingertips that she concealed beneath violet gloves.

"The northern implementation," he repeated carefully. "You mean the military buildup along Tarthenian borders?"

Naimente's expression cooled. "Security enhancement addressing potential destabilization."

"And the eastern agricultural deterioration? The reports of water-related illness spreading through provincial districts?"

Something flickered across her face—momentary surprise quickly suppressed. "Isolated incidents exaggerated through provincial communication inefficiency."

The commanders exchanged subtle glances, their military discipline maintaining neutrality despite evident discomfort. Captain Perrin's expression revealed particular tension—her once-absolute loyalty to Naimente showing increasing fracture lines.

"Perhaps His Majesty might review eastern implementation reports separately," Captain Perrin suggested with careful neutrality. "While military planning proceeds according to established directive."

"An excellent suggestion," Aethen agreed before Naimente could object. "I would speak with Lady Naimente privately regarding eastern provincial concerns."

The flash of irritation crossing Naimente's features betrayed her perspective more clearly than any declaration. She had not anticipated such directness from the husband she had gradually reduced to ceremonial figurehead.

"The council concludes," she stated, her tone brooking no disagreement. 

When commanders had departed, leaving them alone within the cavernous chamber, silence stretched between them—no longer the comfortable quiet of shared understanding but the wary distance of opponents assessing approach.

"You've been investigating beyond administrative channels," Naimente observed, her voice carrying that strange resonance that emerged during confrontation.

"I have been observing rather than merely accepting official pronouncements," Aethen corrected. He moved toward the water channels flowing beneath crystal floor panels, noting their diminished volume and clouded appearance. "Much like these waters, truth flows despite attempts to redirect its course."

He placed the gathered documentation upon the council table. "The eastern provinces report agricultural collapse despite increased irrigation. Village healers document advanced waterlung variants spreading through communities officially declared healthy. The northern water sources show mineral composition changes identical to those preceding Arnekol's destruction."

Naimente's expression remained composed, though that strange fire strengthened behind her eyes. "Provincial reporting naturally contains inconsistencies. Isolated incidents transformed into pattern through selective documentation."

"Not selective but comprehensive," Aethen countered, indicating official seals upon multiple reports. "These assessments bear your own Security Enhancement Division's certification. Your commanders document water quality changes while official proclamations deny their existence."

He turned toward the ancient water symbols carved into chamber walls. "Seventeen generations maintained equilibrium between necessity and restraint. Since Arnekol's destruction, that balance has fractured beyond recognition."

"Balance becomes vulnerability when external threats require decisive response," Naimente replied, each word emerging with unnatural certainty. "The currents of change cannot be contained by channels built for quieter waters."

"The currents of change need guidance, not abandonment of all restraint," Aethen said, his voice taking on the fluid rhythm of traditional Allemarean speech. "When waters rise beyond their banks, we build stronger channels—not unleash floods upon neighboring lands."

He stepped closer, forcing himself to meet her gaze despite the unnatural fire burning there. "What has happened to you, Naimente? The woman who saved my life would never dismiss suffering as 'adaptation difficulty.' The healer who worked without sleep to save northern children would not ignore reports of similar children now dying from water she controls. Since the assassin's blade cut you, something else seems to flow through your veins."

"Purpose requires methodology appropriate to circumstance," she replied, her voice deepening. "When traditional channels preserve suffering beneath procedural appearance, adaptation follows."

"Adaptation or corruption?" Aethen challenged. "The water quality deterioration spreads directly from your redistribution channels. The blue fire that consumed Arnekol now manifests in scaled form throughout eastern provinces. These represent not progress but degradation masked by administrative terminology."

Naimente's expression hardened, the momentary vulnerability entirely extinguished. "Your perspective shows concerning alignment with oppositional interests. Perhaps extended contemplation might clarify administrative necessity."

"I am not some noble faction to be dismissed," Aethen replied, standing straighter than he had in months. "I am King of Allemarea, regardless of how thoroughly you've hollowed that authority. The royal water-seal still bears my bloodline's mark, and it shall henceforth carry my direct opposition to these implementations."

The declaration hung between them, its significance transcending their fractured relationship toward formal governmental opposition.

"The king bears traditional authority," Naimente acknowledged, her tone shifting toward something more dangerous. "Though practical implementation requires adaptive interpretation when necessity contradicts ceremonial limitation."

"Not ceremonial but fundamental," Aethen corrected. "The Bluewater Accord specifically prohibits military action against neighboring realms without full council authorization—which your attack on Arnekol never received. The Eastern Implementation Directive requires environmental impact assessment before resource redistribution—which your current policies deliberately circumvent."

His finger traced the water channel flowing beneath crystal floor panels. "Most significantly, the Sacred Water Trust places ultimate authority over Allemarea's primary water source with the crowned ruler rather than administrative designate. My signature shall no longer appear on directives I have not personally reviewed and approved."

The heat emanating from Naimente intensified, warming the air between them. "Your signature has provided necessary authorization precisely because you remained properly detached from implementation specifics," she stated, the fire behind her eyes now unmistakable.

"No longer," Aethen declared. "I shall address the council directly tomorrow regarding these implementations. The evidence shall be presented in full, without administrative interpretation obscuring fundamental reality."

For a moment—brief but significant—something like fear flashed across Naimente's features, quickly replaced by calculating assessment. She studied him with unnerving intensity, as though seeing him clearly for the first time in months.

"Such declaration represents significant deviation from established protocol," she observed.

"Lord Vaendae opposed your methods, not Allemarea's welfare," Aethen replied. "A distinction I now recognize with painful clarity. His execution proceeded without evidence I found convincing—another oversight I shall no longer permit."

Naimente moved closer, her presence radiating unnatural heat. "You would oppose implementations demonstrating proven effectiveness?" she asked, her voice containing genuine bewilderment beneath the anger. "The northern redistribution has brought water to districts denied adequate supply for generations."

"I would distinguish between genuine improvement and catastrophic degradation masked by administrative terminology," Aethen clarified. "The water redistribution indeed brought initial benefits. But what flows through those channels now bears little resemblance to what originally justified their creation."

He gestured toward eastern provinces on the map table. "Something has changed within the water itself—a transformation your own commanders document while official pronouncements deny its existence. The correlation between this deterioration and your increasingly absolute authority cannot be mere coincidence."

The heat emanating from Naimente intensified further, the air between them shimmering slightly. "Your perspective demonstrates concerning alignment with interests opposed to essential implementation," she stated, her voice resonating strangely. "Perhaps private contemplation might clarify administrative necessity before tomorrow's council presentation."

The implicit threat hung between them, unmistakable despite its diplomatic phrasing.

"The council shall hear truth regardless of administrative preference," Aethen replied, gathering the documentation with deliberate care. "These waters have flowed through seventeen generations of my bloodline. I shall not be the king who watched silently as they turned to poison."

As he turned to leave, Naimente's voice stopped him at the threshold.

"*Daecil aern korvin sethal*," she offered, using the ancient blessing that invoked water's guidance during transition between realms.

The traditional farewell now carried ominous weight, its ceremonial language transformed by current context into what sounded uncomfortably like a threat.

"*Tal'daecil aen korven ethril*," Aethen completed, modifying the traditional response to invoke justice rather than merely completion. "The waters flow where justice guides them."

---

Evening shadows lengthened across Aethen's private garden as he completed preparations for the coming council session. Documentation had been copied in triplicate, with separate packets prepared for secure delivery should the presentation itself be prevented. Seventeen years of careful observation, distilled into evidence even Naimente's most loyal supporters could not dismiss.

"Your Majesty?" Mereth appeared at the garden entrance, his artist's hands bearing a slender wooden box. "The arrangements proceed according to established protocol. Though perhaps additional precaution might prove prudent."

"You mean I should prepare for her to move against me directly," Aethen translated, appreciating the older man's loyalty while recognizing the truth beneath diplomatic phrasing.

"Recent opposition has encountered increasingly definitive response," Mereth acknowledged carefully.

Aethen nodded, gazing toward the diminished water channels flowing through ornamental gardens. "The waters find their proper level despite artificial barriers. Truth flows beyond administrative constraint, though the channel itself might suffer temporary damage."

Mereth placed the wooden box upon the garden table. "The Broken Circle maintains secure communication channels regardless of potential disruption. Documentation shall reach appropriate recipients through established methodology."

"And the council presentation?"

"Preparations proceed according to directive. Though security enhancements suggest potential implementation adaptation." Mereth's careful phrasing contained genuine concern beneath professional detachment.

"She will move against me," Aethen stated simply. "The question becomes whether truth emerges before implementation succeeds."

He opened the wooden box, revealing delicate paper sculptures arranged in precise configuration. Each represented specific documentation—evidence of water quality deterioration, military deployments contradicting official explanations, medical reports from eastern provinces. Through their carefully developed code, these innocuous artworks contained information that would reach the alliance regardless of what transpired at tomorrow's council.

"The distribution proceeds through established channels," Mereth confirmed. "Merchant caravans depart at dawn bell, with primary documentation reaching Tarthenian highlands within seven days."

Aethen lifted a particularly detailed sculpture depicting a mother holding a sick child—symbolic representation of eastern provincial suffering. "Will it matter? If truth emerges after implementation succeeds, does the revelation serve purpose beyond merely historical documentation?"

"Truth maintains value regardless of timeline," Mereth replied. "Though effectiveness increases through acceleration."

They worked in companionable silence as twilight deepened into true night. The paper sculptures—each containing coded information within seemingly decorative folds—were packed carefully into merchant crates bearing innocuous trade documentation. By morning, they would be dispersed throughout regional trade networks, beyond Naimente's capacity to intercept.

"*Daecil aern korvin*," Mereth offered as their work concluded, the traditional blessing carrying both farewell and subtle acknowledgment of risk.

"*Tal'daecil aen korven ethril*," Aethen completed. "The waters flow where justice guides them."

When Mereth had departed, Aethen remained alone within the garden that had once represented their strongest connection. Here, surrounded by medicinal herbs Naimente had planted during happier days, he had watched her transformation from compassionate healer into something he scarcely recognized.

The moon rose above palace walls, casting silver light across diminished water channels. Somewhere beyond these walls, alliance forces prepared implementation based upon documentation he had provided through their covert network. The Broken Circle—Naevin with his scholarly precision, Eilene with her merchant's calculation, Rin with her warrior's determination—represented resistance beyond Naimente's direct control.

Aethen touched the small vial he kept within his robes—water from the northern village where he had first met Naimente, its purity preserved while the kingdom's sources degraded. Tomorrow would determine whether truth flowed beyond constraint or administrative authority succeeded in redirecting its course.

"*Daecil aern korvin*," he whispered to the night. "May these waters restore that which time diminishes."

The garden remained silent save for the diminished trickling of channels that had once flowed abundant. Like Allemarea itself, these waters waned beneath influences their ancient architects had never anticipated. The king who had watched silently as absolute authority consolidated would speak directly against corruption masked by administrative terminology.

As he prepared to return to his chambers, a flicker of movement near the garden entrance caught his attention. Standing in shadow was Captain Perrin, her formal uniform bearing the distinctive insignia of Naimente's Security Enhancement Division. Their eyes met briefly—her expression containing warning rather than threat—before she turned and vanished into the darkness.

The waters would indeed flow where justice guided them—though the channel itself might suffer temporary damage in service to truth beyond constraint.
