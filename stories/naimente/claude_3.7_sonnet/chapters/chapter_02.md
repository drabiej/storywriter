# Chapter 2: Tangled Roots

The memories came to Naimente that night as she lay beside the sleeping prince in chambers far grander than any she had known. Her mind drifted to the northern village where drought had carved deep lines into both land and people.

## I

She had been seven summers when the fever swept through the Heights. Naimente remembered the weight of wet cloths in her small hands as she tended her parents, the bitter taste of yarrow tea she brewed while standing upon a stool, whispered prayers to water spirits long forgotten by the educated south.

"More water, Naime," her father had rasped, using the childhood name now heard only in her dreams.

But there had been precious little water to give. The noble estate to the south maintained its ornamental fountains while the village cistern stood empty. Their district's water allotment had been halved that season, though taxation remained unchanged despite diminished harvests.

Her mother's feverish mumblings turned to prophecy during her final hours: "The violet eyes see true. Remember this, child—they take what is not theirs, and call it tradition. The waters must be rebalanced, or all will run dry."

For three days Naimente worked without sleep, her small hands growing clumsy with exhaustion. On the fourth morning, she awoke to silence. The tinctures she had prepared with such care stood unused beside their still forms.

"You did all that was possible," Aedil said, finding her there. The old healer's face, weathered as northern stones, showed neither excessive sympathy nor dismissal—only recognition. "And you will do more, when you have learned."

That same day, Aedil took her as apprentice. "The hands that work through grief," the old woman observed, "reveal a healer's calling."

The years that followed transformed Naimente. She learned to identify herbs by touch and scent when darkness obscured their form; to feel the subtle shift of bones beneath skin; to sense fever's course through a pulse. She mastered the formal remedies approved by the southern guilds and the northern traditions that predated Allemarea itself.

Aedil's hut stood at the village edge where meadow met forest. Inside hung bundles of dried herbs tied with color-coded thread, while shelves bore clay pots of salves and tinctures labeled in Aedil's precise hand. Most essential was the water filtration system—layered stone, sand, and charcoal basins that purified even the muddiest stream water.

"A healer's first medicine is clean water," Aedil taught her. "When water flows pure through the body, half of all ailments resolve themselves."

One evening as they sat beside the hearth where burdock root simmered, filling the hut with earthy steam, Aedil studied her apprentice thoughtfully. "You have been blessed with the seeing eyes. Among the northern peoples, violet eyes were once thought to mark those who could perceive the unseen patterns of illness and health—particularly the flow of water through body and land."

"The village children call them witch-eyes," Naimente replied, remembering the whispers that had followed her.

"People fear what they cannot explain," Aedil said, stirring the kettle with a carved wooden spoon. "Remember this when they come to you in desperation, then whisper behind their hands after you have healed them."

By sixteen, Naimente had gained a reputation beyond their village. Some came with suspicion in their eyes, having heard tales of the northern healer with witch-eyes, but departed with gratitude and small offerings—a measure of grain, a carefully preserved apple, a length of woven cloth.

Aedil watched her growing confidence with concern. "You seek to overcome death itself," she observed after Naimente had worked through two nights to save an elderly woodcutter whom everyone had believed beyond help.

"Is that not our purpose?" Naimente asked, washing blood from her hands. "To stand against suffering and death for as long as possible?"

"Our purpose is to ease suffering and aid healing, not to challenge the natural order through will alone." Aedil's eyes darkened. "The healer who cannot bear to lose a patient risks becoming something other than a healer."

"And what would that be?" Naimente asked, meeting her gaze directly.

"The power to heal and the power to harm flow from the same source," Aedil replied. "The difference lies in intention, and intentions can shift like water over stone—gradually, invisibly, until the landscape is transformed."

Naimente dismissed these words as an old woman's caution—until Lyra came.

## II

The child was brought to Aedil's hut at dawn, carried in her father's trembling arms. No more than four summers old, with hair like sun-touched wheat and skin already bearing the blue-tinged pallor of waterlung.

"Three days of fever," the father, Kevan, said, voice breaking. "Then the coughing began. She cannot keep water down."

The mother, Mira, stood silent beside them, her face bearing the peculiar stillness that Naimente recognized as the deepest fear—a mother preparing for loss while desperately hoping for salvation.

Waterlung had become increasingly common since the southern nobles had redirected clean mountain streams to their estates, leaving villages dependent on stagnant ponds. Children suffered most severely.

"Prepare the juniper steam," she instructed Aedil, already mixing willow bark and thyme tea. "And the moss poultice for her chest."

They worked with practiced efficiency, applying remedies that had saved dozens with similar symptoms. But Lyra's small body surrendered its warmth with frightening speed, her breath coming in shallow gasps that rattled with fluid.

"This isn't working," Naimente whispered as evening fell, the child's condition worsening. "The infection has reached her blood."

Aedil's expression confirmed her assessment. "We have done what can be done. Now we make her comfortable and prepare her parents."

"No." The word emerged more forcefully than intended. "There must be something more. The fever root from the high valley—"

"Too strong for a child her size," Aedil countered gently.

"Diluted properly, with sweetgrass to buffer its effects—"

"Naimente." Aedil rarely used her full name. "Some battles cannot be won. This is not failure, but the natural course."

"Natural?" Naimente gestured toward the window where torches from the noble estate blazed in the distance. "There is nothing natural about clean water diverted to ornamental pools while children drink from mud puddles. This isn't fate—it's greed masked as tradition."

"The patterns of power are not easily changed," Aedil said softly.

"Then perhaps Allemarea needs more than healers," Naimente replied, her voice hardening.

Aedil placed a worn wooden box in her hands. "If you must try, use these. The last sacred herbs from the shrine clearing. I had saved them for my final crossing."

Through the second night, Naimente worked alone. She created tinctures more potent than any she had previously dared, calculating dosages at the edge of safety. When Lyra could no longer swallow, she administered remedies through poultices and steam, calling upon techniques described in Aedil's oldest manuscripts.

By the third dawn, her eyes burned from sleeplessness, her hands trembling with exhaustion. The child's breathing had grown so shallow that Naimente placed a feather before her lips to detect it.

"Please," she whispered, no longer certain whether she addressed the child, the absent water spirits, or some deeper power. "Please."

The sun climbed toward midday, casting light across Lyra's face. For a moment, the child's eyes opened—clear and aware.

"Am I going to the water-beyond?" she asked, using the northern term for the afterlife.

"No," Naimente promised. "I won't allow it."

Lyra smiled, the expression transforming her blue-tinged features. "The fire lady says otherwise. She's waiting for me."

Before Naimente could question these strange words, the child's eyes closed. Three shallow breaths followed, each fainter than the last, then stillness.

Naimente's cry held no words, only raw denial. Her hands pressed against the child's chest as though physical force could restart the stilled heart. When that failed, she gathered the small body into her arms, rocking back and forth.

Aedil found her thus when she returned with Lyra's parents. "Naimente," she said softly. "You must let her go."

It required both Aedil and Kevan to loosen her grip. As the parents took their daughter, Mira paused to place a work-roughened hand against Naimente's cheek.

"You fought as though she were your own," the mother said, her voice steady despite her grief. "We will remember."

After they departed, Naimente remained motionless, staring at the small indentation where Lyra had lain. The failure burned in her chest like molten metal, hardening her resolve. Never again would she accept limitation. Never again would she surrender to the "natural course" when that course had been corrupted by human greed.

"You need rest," Aedil said, touching her shoulder.

Naimente shook her head. "I need answers."

## III

The shrine stood in a clearing half a day's journey into the forest, its weathered stones arranged in a pattern whose meaning had been lost to all but the oldest village elders. At its center rose a stone plinth bearing symbols scholars identified as ancient Ruinekarian. The primary symbol—a stylized flame surrounded by a triangle—had been partially obscured by centuries of erosion.

Naimente reached the shrine as twilight gathered beneath the ancient trees. Three days without sleep had left her mind floating strangely beyond her body. The cool stone beneath her fingers as she traced the central symbol seemed more real than her own flesh.

"I have failed," she spoke aloud, her voice startling a nearby thrush into flight. "Show me how not to fail again."

Following half-remembered ritual instructions, she poured the remaining sacred herbs, diluted in spring water, into a small depression at the plinth's base. The fluid spread, following channels worn into the stone by centuries of similar offerings.

"*Eth'ren silathae murend'da*," she whispered, recalling ancient words from Aedil's oldest texts. "I offer what remains. That which could not save one life, I give to learn how to save many."

As darkness claimed the clearing, Naimente knelt, her head bowed in exhaustion. Sleep came unbidden, drawing her into dreams more vivid than waking.

The stone symbols now glowed with internal light, casting red-gold illumination across the clearing. The air shimmered with heat that didn't burn, and the forest beyond had vanished, replaced by endless golden sand beneath a starless sky. The scent of hot metal and desert spice filled her nostrils, while her skin prickled with electricity that seemed to dance between her and the stones.

A presence moved within the heated air—not visible, but sensed. It circled her, the sound of its movement like wind through narrow canyons.

*You seek what lies beyond your grasp*, a voice whispered, resonating directly in her mind rather than disturbing the air. *You would challenge death itself.*

"I would heal what has been broken," Naimente replied, the words tasting like ash in her mouth. "I would restore balance where greed has disrupted the natural flow."

The presence drew closer. Heat radiated against her face like standing before an open forge. Something brushed against her consciousness—a sensation of being examined from within.

*Your intentions seem pure now. They always do at first.*

The air contracted suddenly, concentrating before her in a shimmering distortion that almost—but not quite—formed a human shape. Within that distortion, violet eyes identical to her own regarded her, and above them, a crown of living flame burned with terrible beauty.

*I am Tarashren*, the presence pulsed rather than spoke. *Your grief has opened a door long sealed.*

"Will you help me?" Naimente asked, her voice small against the vastness surrounding them.

A sensation like laughter rippled through the heated air. *Help is rarely what it seems. Power has its price.*

"I would pay any price to prevent more needless deaths," she said firmly.

The flame-crowned presence flickered, its edges expanding and contracting like a heartbeat. *Remember those words when the time comes to honor them.*

Heat seared through Naimente's body, flowing from her feet to her crown. For a moment, she glimpsed patterns beneath the world's surface—veins of water flowing through earth, currents of blood moving through bodies, connections between all living things that pulsed with common rhythm.

*Your eyes already see true*, Tarashren's voice faded like cooling embers. *Now your hands may follow.*

Naimente woke with dawn light filtering through the leaves above, dew soaking her clothing. The shrine stones stood silent around her, showing no trace of her vision. The depression where she had poured her offering was dry, as though the stone itself had consumed the liquid.

As she turned to leave, a sudden breeze stirred the clearing, causing leaves to dance across the shrine stones. For a moment, their pattern echoed the flame symbol, but inverted—fire leaping upward from below rather than descending from above.

Naimente departed with measured steps, not looking back.

## IV

The hunt had not been planned to pass so close to their village. Royal hunting parties typically remained within the forests surrounding noble estates. But a magnificent stag had led the hunters astray, drawing them northward into wilder terrain.

Prince Aethen, younger and less cautious than his companions, had pursued the stag beyond sight of his escort. His horse stumbled on loose shale, throwing its rider against jagged stone. By the time the royal guards located him, the prince lay unconscious, blood seeping from a head wound that exposed bone.

The village was closer than the nearest estate, and the court physician deemed the prince too unstable for the longer journey. Thus royal guards carried Allemarea's second son to Aedil's humble healing hut as twilight descended.

"Court physicians believe the wound mortal," the lead guard informed them, his ceremonial armor incongruous against the hut's rough-hewn walls. "But we were ordered to seek any aid while the Royal Physician prepares the appropriate rituals for a prince's passing."

Naimente gave no acknowledgment, her attention focused entirely on the unconscious prince. She cut away his fine clothing, revealing not only the head wound but also three broken ribs and internal bleeding evidenced by the spreading purple discoloration across his abdomen.

Her hands moved with newfound certainty. Since her night at the shrine two seasons past, her abilities had sharpened inexplicably, allowing her to perceive patterns of injury with supernatural accuracy.

The Royal Physician arrived as they worked, his blue-and-silver robes sweeping the dirt floor. He observed their preparations with poorly concealed disdain.

"The channels of healing must flow in their proper courses," he announced, the formal water metaphors of Allemarean nobility sounding stiff and rehearsed. "We appreciate your... preliminary treatment. However, a prince requires remedies sanctioned by the proper authorities."

He gestured to attendants bearing ornate boxes containing guild-approved remedies—preparations Naimente recognized as not only insufficient for injuries of this severity, but actively harmful in combination.

"Your preparations will thin his blood when he is already bleeding internally," she stated, continuing to clean the head injury. "The yarrow essence in your standard treatment will worsen his condition."

The physician's face reddened. "I don't expect a village healer to understand royal treatment protocols. These remedies follow traditions established four centuries ago by the founding healers of Allemarea."

"Then they were wrong," Naimente replied without looking up. "His skull is fractured and pressing against his brain. He requires immediate intervention or he will be dead by morning."

"You dare suggest—" the physician began, but Aedil interrupted with surprising authority.

"The witch-eyes see true," she said simply. "If you wish your prince to live, you will assist or depart—but you will not interfere."

Something in her tone silenced him, though his expression promised future consequences. Near the doorway, Naimente noticed several foreign observers—one wearing the distinctive golden sash of Arnekol merchants, another the scholarly robes of Kor with their characteristic indigo trim. A third stood slightly apart, her posture marking her as Tarthenian despite civilian clothing.

Through the night, Naimente worked with focused intensity. She used delicate bone needles to relieve pressure on the prince's brain, herbal compresses to reduce swelling, and tinctures to slow internal bleeding. The foreign observers watched intently as her methods achieved results that guild-approved treatments could not match.

By dawn, the prince's breathing had stabilized and the dangerous pressure within his skull had decreased. As morning light filtered through the window, Prince Aethen opened his eyes—clear hazel eyes that fixed immediately on Naimente's violet gaze.

"Am I dead?" he asked, voice weak but coherent. "They said the water-beyond is guarded by spirits with unusual eyes."

"Not dead," Naimente replied, "though you've approached the threshold more closely than most who return."

A ghost of a smile touched his pale lips. "Yet here I am. Through your doing?"

"Through your body's strength as much as my intervention," she answered honestly. "Though perhaps with some assistance from powers beyond understanding."

The Royal Physician stepped forward, attempting to reassert authority. "Your Highness must rest now. We shall prepare for your return to the palace."

Aethen's gaze remained fixed on Naimente. "You used methods not taught in the royal healing chambers."

"Methods older than your kingdom," she confirmed, wiping blood from her hands with a cloth. "From traditions your ancestors sought to replace."

Instead of taking offense, the prince's expression showed interest. "There is much, I think, that my ancestors failed to understand." His hand moved slightly, seeking hers. "Tell me your name."

"Naimente," she answered, allowing her scarred fingers to meet his uncallused ones.

"Honesty as effective as your remedies," the prince murmured. "Rare in the circles I inhabit."

For seven days, Prince Aethen remained in Aedil's hut, regaining strength under Naimente's care. During those days, they discovered unexpected common ground.

"The water does not flow properly throughout the kingdom," Aethen observed on the fifth day, sitting upright for the first time. "The ancient channels are failing while court engineers maintain ceremonial fountains."

"An unusual observation for a prince," Naimente noted, preparing a fresh poultice.

"The northern provinces suffer while southern estates flourish," he continued, tracing patterns on his blanket. "Fourteen trade houses have collapsed, yet taxation remains unchanged. Few at court acknowledge the connection between water rights and public health."

On their final night before the prince's departure, they spoke by lamplight of matters rarely discussed between healer and patient—systemic problems affecting the kingdom, traditions maintained without understanding their purpose, privilege sustained at common expense.

"You speak of healing on a scale beyond herbs and poultices," Naimente observed.

"Treating symptoms provides temporary relief, but addressing causes creates lasting health," Aethen replied. "The water issues in Allemarea are symptoms of deeper corruption."

"Your mother, Queen Iolara, leads the conservative faction that maintains traditional water distributions," he explained. "She's particularly suspicious of northern influences—she'll view your methods as threatening."

Three days after the prince's departure, royal messengers arrived with an unprecedented summons: Naimente was invited to the palace to continue the prince's treatment and to discuss northern healing traditions with interested court members.

Aedil watched her prepare for the journey with troubled eyes. "Be wary," she cautioned. "The southern court views northern knowledge as either primitive superstition or dangerous competition."

"Yet change cannot come from standing apart," Naimente replied, packing her most essential remedies. "If there is opportunity to influence those with power, should I not take it?"

"Power flows in both directions," Aedil warned. "When you enter their current, you may find yourself carried to destinations other than those you intended."

"Queen Iolara destroys threats to tradition," she added quietly. "A scholar from Kor disappeared after writing about ancient water infrastructure. Remember this when court factions approach you."

Naimente embraced the old woman, inhaling the familiar scent of healing herbs. "I will remember," she promised.

As she mounted the horse provided by the royal messengers, Naimente looked back at the village that had shaped her. The contrast between its weathered simplicity and her destination could not have been greater.

"The waters gather where they will," Aedil called, using an ancient northern blessing. "May yours flow toward healing."

Naimente raised her hand in farewell, then turned toward the south, where the capital's towers shimmered in the distance like a mirage—as insubstantial as dreams, yet solid enough to cast shadows across half the kingdom.

---

In the royal bedchamber, Naimente opened her eyes to darkness, the memories receding like tide from shore. Beside her, Aethen slept peacefully, unaware of her midnight journey through the past. She touched her healer's hands, remembering when they had first taken his in that humble northern hut.

"I have not forgotten," she whispered to the night.

The sound of flowing water through the palace walls seemed to respond, its rhythm shifting subtly from peaceful flow to something more urgent—a warning, perhaps, that water, once directed into new channels, follows its own inevitable course to the sea.
