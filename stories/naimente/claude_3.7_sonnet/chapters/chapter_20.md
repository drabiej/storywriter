# Chapter 20: Distant Banners

Winter winds howled across Tarthenia's highlands, driving snow against the fortress carved from living mountain seventeen generations past. Massive hearths blazed against the gathering cold, their light casting long shadows across weapons adorning walls of weathered granite.

Rin Tarthan stood before the ancestral fire, her shadow stretching toward the circular stone table where clan leaders had gathered. The formal uniform of Tarthenia's Mountain Guard hung upon her frame—deep green fabric with highland patterns, silver clasps bearing her clan's peaks insignia.

Four weeks had passed since her escape from Allemarea, yet her cousin's execution remained a bleeding wound in her soul. She still saw the document in her nightmares, the clinical notation from Naimente's security archives: *Security Classification: Terminated. Implementation Date: Three Days Prior.* That discovery—that Aric had been killed while she was still fighting to save him—had shattered something inside her that would never heal.

"The sacred peaks witness this gathering," King Faolan intoned. Unlike Allemarean ceremony with elaborate water rituals, Tarthenian tradition valued simplicity.

The king's gray-streaked beard was trimmed short, his eyes—the same deep green as Rin's—holding both pride and concern as they rested briefly upon his daughter.

"Three lands stand before the mountain," he continued. "Three traditions united before common threat."

Naevin Daecilrith approached the central fire. The scholar's hesitant posture had changed since their escape from Allemarea. The ink-stained fingers still marked him as a scholar, but his movements carried a newfound purpose. His sister's death had transformed academic inquiry into personal mission.

"The Forum of Kor offers knowledge," he said, placing a weathered book upon the stone table.

Eilene Anaedrui followed, her merchant's golden hair now dulled with ash. Burns marked her forearms where blue fire had touched her during Arnekol's destruction. Three weeks ago, she had made life-or-death decisions as she led thousands through mountain passages, leaving behind volunteer elders to create diversions while children escaped.

"Arnekol brings survival through adaptation," she said, adding a merchant's scale to the table.

Rin stepped forward last, placing her iron war-dagger beside the other tokens.

"Tarthenia offers strength when mountains meet valley," she said. "*Tal'varin kor'ethrin*—when stone stands, waters break against it."

The formal alliance had been forged through shared suffering. It had begun as clandestine meetings in the underground water tunnels of Allemarea, where they had named themselves the Three-Fold Witness. Now, their resistance had transformed into open defiance.

Naevin had escaped with detailed documentation of Naimente's descent from reformer to tyrant. Eilene had survived both imprisonment and the supernatural destruction of Arnekol when the blue fire—the manifestation of Tarashren's essence working through Naimente—had consumed the merchant city. Rin had lost her cousin to Naimente's interrogators, his execution transforming diplomatic observation into blood debt.

King Faolan gestured toward the map carved into the stone table—a topographical representation of the four realms with metal markers indicating military positions.

"Allemarea's forces consolidate along northern and eastern approaches," Rin reported. "The supernatural fire that consumed Arnekol represents threat beyond conventional weapons."

"Not mere weaponry," Naevin said, leaning forward. "My research shows an acceleration of her transformation following the assassination attempt four weeks ago—that blade across her ribs was the catalyst for her final descent."

Eilene moved marker pieces representing Arnekol's surviving forces. "Seventeen trading houses have pledged remaining resources." Her fingers unconsciously traced the interrogation scars on her wrist, still fresh enough to redden under pressure.

The clan leaders listened with disciplined attention. Unlike Allemarean councils with their elaborate discussions, Tarthenian leadership valued directness.

"The highland clans stand ready," Clan Leader Voran declared, his weather-beaten face bearing the distinctive scarring of mountain battles. "Yet full mobilization requires council confirmation."

King Faolan's expression remained neutral, though Rin noted the tension in his shoulders. Her father had always favored defensive posture over offensive engagement.

"Allemarea's intentions extend beyond mere border adjustment," Rin said. "Their mineral testing of highland water sources indicates preparation for comprehensive territorial assertion."

"And yet," King Faolan observed, "full military engagement transforms border protection into regional conflict with unpredictable consequences." He turned toward Eilene. "Arnekol's destruction, while tragic, might be a singular demonstration rather than prelude to extended campaign."

The merchant's eyes flashed. "I witnessed Naimente's transformation firsthand during my imprisonment. Her interrogators questioned me extensively about Arnekol's water systems before unleashing the blue fire. She called it 'necessary purification' preceding broader implementation."

Naevin stepped forward. "The historical documentation suggests predictable progression. Regent Elian's reforms followed identical trajectory—beginning with legitimate improvements, proceeding through administrative consolidation, culminating in territorial assertion. Most concerning is the deteriorating water quality throughout Allemarea, despite Naimente's initial improvements."

"The question isn't if we act, but when," Eilene cut in. "My calculations suggest Allemarea will move against the highlands within three months—before winter fully sets in but after consolidating their eastern territories."

"While immediate action before proper preparation creates vulnerability," countered Clan Leader Doran, his scarred hands resting on the map. "Our forces need at least six weeks to reach readiness."

"Six weeks may be six weeks too many," Eilene replied. "Arnekol waited, and now our city lies in ashes."

The debate intensified, voices overlapping with competing timelines.

"*Tal'vorith nen'saren!*" Rin's voice cut through the discord, the highland battle command for silence. The sudden outburst created momentary stillness.

"The question isn't when we strike," she said, softer now. "But how we prepare for maximum effect when we do."

Naevin nodded. "We need three elements—comprehensive intelligence, coordinated deployment, and precise timing. Rather than arguing dates, we should establish readiness thresholds that determine the optimal moment."

"*Tal'meren vos'karith*," King Faolan agreed. "The wise warrior sharpens the blade while watching the horizon."

The war council proceeded with methodical precision. Through extended discussion, alliance strategy emerged—combining Tarthenian mountain knowledge, Kor's historical analysis, and Arnekol's organizational efficiency.

"The command structure must be established," King Faolan said finally. "Current circumstances require adaptation beyond traditional governance."

His gaze turned toward Rin. "Commander Tarthan's experience with Allemarean methodology provides essential insight. Her direct observation of Naimente's tactical approach, combined with her Mountain Guard training, suggests optimal capacity."

Murmurs spread through the assembled clan leaders—not dissent but thoughtful consideration of this unprecedented proposal. Tarthenian tradition had always valued council deliberation above individual authority.

"The highland forces accept Commander Tarthan's directive authority," declared Clan Leader Voran. "Though overall strategy remains subject to council confirmation."

Rin inclined her head. "I serve the highlands, not myself."

"Commander Tarthan directs tactical implementation," King Faolan continued. "Scholar Daecilrith coordinates intelligence. Representative Anaedrui manages resources and civilian evacuation preparation."

"We face a terrible truth," Naevin said quietly. "To counter Naimente's tactics, we must employ methods we once condemned. Our intelligence network requires infiltration strategies similar to those we criticized. Our military response necessitates preemptive strikes we once considered dishonorable."

"The difference lies in purpose," Eilene said. "Naimente's intentions degraded from reform to power consolidation. Our methods serve protection, not domination."

"Yet intention alone provides insufficient distinction when action transforms the actor," King Faolan noted. "*Tal'verin soreth nen'karith*—the warrior who studies enemy's blade risks wielding it beyond necessity."

When formal council adjourned, Rin remained beside the strategic map, her fingers tracing mountain passes where Tarthenian forces would soon deploy. The iron pendant beneath her uniform seemed unusually heavy against her chest—the clan emblem carrying ancestral blessing that had failed to protect her cousin.

"The mountain remembers its own," King Faolan said, approaching with the measured steps of a warrior managing old battle injuries.

Rin kept her eyes on the map. "My cousin's execution demanded blood price according to ancient tradition. Yet I know personal vengeance cannot guide military strategy."

"The warrior serves highland defense," he observed. "Yet defense transforms when battlefield extends beyond mountain borders."

His hand rested briefly upon her shoulder—rare physical acknowledgment that betrayed genuine concern beneath royal authority. "The council confirms alliance implementation. Full mobilization proceeds according to proposed strategy."

The declaration represented significant policy adjustment. Throughout his reign, King Faolan had maintained strict defensive posture—mountain warriors protecting highland territories while avoiding entanglement in lowland conflicts.

"The highlands honor your leadership," Rin said.

"The highlands have always defended their own," King Faolan replied. "Though battlefield sometimes extends beyond immediate borders when threat challenges fundamental survival."

Firelight caught the weathered lines of his face—each representing campaigns, decisions, and losses that had shaped Tarthenia's independence. The gray at his temples had appeared during the Southeastern Conflict. His left hand bore subtle scarring from the Battle of Karver Pass, when he had personally held mountain approach against overwhelming opposition.

"The council worries about your personal involvement," he added, his voice softening. "Command proceeds most effectively through strategic direction rather than frontline risk."

"Stone learns strength through direct pressure," she replied. "The Mountain Guard maintains tradition through action, not merely direction."

A ghost of a smile touched his face. "Your mother said something similar before the Northern Campaign." The comparison to her mother—legendary Mountain Guard commander who had fallen defending northern passes when Rin was still a child—carried both honor and implicit warning.

"I won't be reckless," she assured him. "Strategic direction over personal engagement."

When planning concluded near midnight, Rin found herself walking mountain battlements despite the howling blizzard, the cold cutting through her uniform. From this elevation, distant valleys spread before her—moonlight occasionally penetrating storm clouds to illuminate landscapes connecting highland territories with lowland realms.

The documentation she'd discovered in Naimente's private archives confirmed transformation beyond explanation—the strangely flame-like quality observed within her violet eyes corresponding with increasingly absolute implementation. The supernatural element—that entity named Tarashren whose presence had intensified since the assassination attempt—suggested influence beyond merely human ambition.

Eventually, physical discomfort drove her toward personal quarters. Unlike Allemarean chambers with their ornamental luxury, Tarthenian living spaces embodied practical efficiency. Her room contained a narrow sleeping platform, weapon display, equipment maintenance station, and small hearth providing minimal warmth.

Most revealing was the unexpected feature visitors found surprising—a small table bearing carving implements and partially completed wooden figures. The artistic practice had begun during adolescent military training, when commander Veraan had instructed recruits to develop precision skills through non-martial implementation.

Rin removed her formal uniform, replacing ceremonial attire with practical clothing. She selected a piece of highland oak from her collection—traditionally used for commemorating those lost during military service.

Her hands worked instinctively, the blade removing excess material to reveal the form beneath. The wooden figure emerging captured her cousin's distinctive features—the prominent cheekbones characteristic of their clan line, the strong jaw indicating stubborn determination, the slight tilt of head suggesting intelligent assessment. More telling were the subtle indications of torture evident in posture and expression—hints of suffering deliberately included to ensure accurate commemoration.

As she worked, tears finally escaped her iron discipline—silent mourning permitted only within private sanctuary. The sharp smell of fresh-cut wood filled her nostrils as she carved the date into the base—the day she'd found evidence of his execution, the moment that had transformed her mission.

Her hands trembled slightly as she carved, but the blade remained precise. The ritual's familiar rhythm gradually restored her balance, transforming raw grief into focused purpose.

When the figure was complete, Rin placed it upon a small shelf bearing similar carvings—sixteen representations commemorating those whose lives had shaped her. Her mother's figure occupied central position, carved from memory years after her death. Beside that stood her first commander, killed during a border skirmish. Each figure represented specific relationship, loss, and lesson.

"*Tal'varin kor'sethal*," she whispered, the ancient Highland blessing for warriors fallen beyond mountain soil. "The mountain remembers its own."

Dawn found Rin standing before assembled reconnaissance teams—seventeen warriors selected for specific capabilities. Unlike ceremonial farewells typical in lowland military tradition, Tarthenian deployment proceeded with efficient directness.

"*Tal'varin kor'ethrin*," she stated simply. "When stone stands, waters break against it."

The assembled warriors tapped closed fists against leather chest pieces—the distinctive Tarthenian salute symbolizing heart protected yet committed. Without additional ceremony, they departed toward mountain passes where danger awaited beyond highland protection.

First Lieutenant Tervan, leader of the eastern reconnaissance team, paused briefly. "We'll place observation points along the water distribution channels as directed. If blue fire comes, we'll ensure the highlands have warning."

"Watch for changes in the water itself," Rin said. "Naevin believes there may be mineral alterations before any attack."

"And if we encounter Allemarean scouts?" Tervan asked.

Rin met his gaze steadily. "Observe only. No engagement unless absolutely necessary for survival."

"And if they've already poisoned the water sources?"

"Collect samples. Return immediately." She gripped his forearm briefly. "No heroics, Tervan. Information is what we need now."

He nodded once, then turned to join his team disappearing into the swirling snow.

Rin watched their departure with composed expression that betrayed nothing of the responsibility weighing upon her shoulders. These warriors—fellow Mountain Guard members whose training she had shared—now ventured into extraordinary danger based upon her assessment and direction.

"The stone returns though waters temporarily cover it," King Faolan said, approaching despite the early hour. "Highland warriors maintain connection regardless of separation."

"The mountain remembers its own," Rin replied.

As morning light strengthened, distant peaks emerged from storm clouds. Alliance implementation had begun through reconnaissance teams establishing presence beyond highland borders. Stone would stand against water, mountain would resist valley current, tradition would confront transformation.

Somewhere beyond snow-covered passes, Allemarea continued evolving beneath Naimente's increasingly destructive vision. The northern healer who had once fought to save fevered children now ordered executions and unleashed supernatural blue fire. Her transformation from compassionate reformer toward destructive tyrant would meet highland resistance.

The waters of change flowed throughout the approaching conflict. Whether those waters would nourish sustainable transformation or gradually carve destructive channels remained to be seen. The highlands stood ready—stone prepared against water, mountain against valley, tradition against corrupted transformation.

Distant banners moved through mountain passes, alliance implementation proceeding beyond planning toward action. What had begun as observation had evolved toward resistance. Together they had witnessed Naimente's transformation from healer to tyrant. Together they would implement resistance against her increasingly absolute authority.

Rin turned toward the strategic planning chambers where alliance coordination continued. The iron pendant against her chest provided comforting weight as she moved from observation toward action. The stone remembered its own, the mountain protected its children, the highlands defended their traditions.

The mountain would stand, regardless of the flood that broke against it.
