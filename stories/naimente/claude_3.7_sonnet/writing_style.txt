1. TONE: Maintain a serious, formal tone with tragic undertones throughout the narrative. Treat the story as a historical tragedy being recounted with gravity and significance. Emphasize moral complexity without overt judgment, allowing readers to witness the protagonist's fall and form their own conclusions about whether corruption stems from "human ambition, psychological breakdown, or something more ancient and malevolent." Present moments of violence and political maneuvering with unflinching clarity rather than sensationalism.

2. PERSPECTIVE: Employ rotating third-person limited perspectives following a strategic pattern. Focus primarily on Naimente in Act I with single chapters from foreign observers, then distribute perspectives more evenly as the story progresses. Show critical scenes from unexpected viewpoints—particularly Naimente's most sympathetic moments through her opponents' eyes. When transitioning between perspectives, anchor each new viewpoint with a distinctive sensory detail or thought pattern specific to that character.

3. SENTENCE STRUCTURE: Craft measured, unhurried prose with deliberate cadence rather than modern conversational flow. Use complex, descriptive sentences for worldbuilding, ritual descriptions, and moments of significance. Employ more direct, economical sentences during action sequences. For passages of heightened importance or ancient history, adopt a paratactic style with clauses joined by "and" to create rhythmic, almost ritual-like quality.

4. DIALOGUE STYLE: Develop distinct speech patterns for each culture—water metaphors and formal syntax for Allemarea nobles, precise philosophical cadence for Kor scholars, direct heroic language for Tarthenia warriors, and trade terminology for Arnekol merchants. Avoid contractions and modern colloquialisms in formal or ceremonial speech. Use direct address and appropriate titles when characters of different stations interact. Include occasional untranslated Ruinekarian terms where context provides meaning, particularly in rituals and formal declarations.

5. DESCRIPTION LEVEL: Provide lavish, detailed descriptions of landscapes, architecture, and rituals with "meticulous attention to seasonal patterns and geographical realities." Present physical sensations with visceral language that "emphasizes human frailty against ancient forces." Render buildings through weathered details suggesting centuries of history. Describe each culture's clothing, food, and dwellings with specific details suggesting long development. Use light, shadow, and colors with attention to their symbolic significance within each culture, particularly water imagery for Allemarea.

6. PACING: Maintain a deliberately measured pace that allows space for detailed descriptions and character development, with strategic variations to create tension. Accelerate during critical confrontations and battles. Create "false resolution points" where hope appears before being extinguished. Control information release through strategic POV selection, showing key events through the eyes of characters with limited understanding before revealing the full context. Allow distinct pacing patterns for different cultures—methodical for Kor scholars, direct for Tarthenia warriors.

7. LANGUAGE PREFERENCES: Use formal language with occasional archaic terms ("deem," "moot," "hearken," "ere") deployed strategically rather than consistently. Include fragments of songs, proverbs, and ceremonial phrases with deliberately archaic phrasing. Incorporate untranslated Ruinekarian terms for water rituals, titles, and spiritual concepts where context provides meaning. Create linguistic variations between cultures while maintaining readability. Avoid modern slang, contractions in formal speech, and contemporary references.

8. OVERALL VOICE: Narrate as a knowledgeable chronicler recounting events of historical significance—someone familiar with all cultures involved who recognizes the tragic patterns unfolding. Reference distant events as living memory that shapes current decisions. Treat customs and rituals as having evolved over generations with layers of meaning often forgotten by characters but understood by the narrator. Describe landscapes and ancient structures with reverence. Present belief systems as lived realities rather than abstract philosophies, maintaining ambiguity about supernatural elements throughout.
