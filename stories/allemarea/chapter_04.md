## Chapter 4: THE PRINCE'S HUNT

Dawn mist clung to the ancient oaks of the Westwood, transforming the forest into a realm of shifting shadows and golden light. Prince Aethen Ael'Dae of Allemarea sat apart from his hunting party, perched on a moss-covered stone with a leather-bound sketchbook balanced on his knees. His light brown hair—called ama'lhe in the old tongue, meaning "delicate as morning light"—was tied back with a simple blue ribbon that matched the embroidery on his hunting clothes. Though finely made, his attire lacked the ostentatious ornamentation typical of Allemarean nobility.

His slender fingers moved deftly across the page, capturing the way morning light filtered through the canopy. The charcoal rendering took shape with surprising speed—evidence of years spent in devoted practice rather than mere dabbling. Nearby, his hunting companions prepared their weapons and discussed strategy, their exuberant voices carrying through the quiet forest. Aethen paid them little mind, absorbed in the interplay of light and shadow.

"Your Highness," called Lord Brennan, approaching with barely concealed impatience. A bear of a man with ruddy cheeks and an elaborate mustache, he embodied the martial values Aethen's mother constantly wished her son would embrace. "The trackers have found fresh boar signs. We should move quickly if we're to make a successful hunt."

Aethen looked up, his hazel eyes reluctantly leaving his sketch. "Of course, Lord Brennan. Just... one moment more." He made a few final strokes, capturing the way dew droplets scattered light across a spider's web.

Brennan sighed, a sound Aethen had heard countless times from courtiers who found his artistic pursuits beneath a prince's dignity. "The daylight won't wait, Your Highness, nor will the game."

"Beauty is as worthy of pursuit as any boar, Lord Brennan," Aethen replied with a gentle smile, closing his sketchbook and tucking it carefully into his satchel. "But I've kept you waiting long enough."

Captain Davan Trell, commander of Aethen's personal guard, approached leading the prince's horse—a dappled gray mare chosen for its gentle temperament rather than martial appearance. Unlike Brennan, Trell's weather-beaten face showed no impatience, only quiet understanding of his charge's nature.

"Another masterpiece, Your Highness?" Trell asked, genuinely curious. In his forty years of service, the captain had developed a knack for seeing the person beneath the crown.

"Hardly that," Aethen said, mounting with practiced ease despite his slender build. "But there's a quality to the light in these woods that I've never seen in the royal gardens. Something wilder, less... constrained."

Trell nodded, understanding the unspoken comparison. "Different beauties for different places. Like different strengths for different men."

Aethen glanced at the captain with appreciation. Among all the palace staff, only Trell seemed to truly see him—not just the crown prince, but the artist and observer who lived behind the royal façade.

As they rode to rejoin the hunting party—twelve noblemen and their attendants, an excessive entourage that Aethen had failed to reduce despite his best efforts—he felt the familiar weight of expectation settle upon his shoulders. His father, King Rinthal, had insisted on this hunt, concerned that his only son spent too much time with "charcoals and parchments" and not enough developing the martial skills expected of Allemarea's future ruler.

"A king must be seen to hunt," his mother had lectured when he'd protested. "The people respect strength, Aethen. Your sketches and compositions will not defend our borders or command respect at court." Queen Iolara's voice had been cold and dismissive, as it always was when discussing her son's "inadequacies."

He had acquiesced, as he always did. Twenty-seven years had taught him the futility of direct opposition to Queen Iolara's will. She would never understand that his interests weren't mere frivolity but a genuine connection to a world beyond palace intrigue—a world she had long since forgotten existed.

The hunting party moved deeper into the forest, following the trackers who walked ahead with hunting hounds straining at their leashes. Aethen rode near the middle of the procession, observing how the quality of light changed as they entered denser woodland. The nobles chatted amongst themselves, occasional laughter punctuating their conversation. Talk of court politics, marriage prospects, and territorial disputes drifted back to him—the eternal concerns of the Allemarean nobility, disconnected from the lives of common people.

Aethen's thoughts wandered to his secret excursions beyond the palace walls in simpler times—disguised in clothes borrowed from his music tutor's son, walking unrecognized among merchants and craftspeople. Those rare moments of freedom had shown him an Allemarea his parents never acknowledged: tradespeople struggling under heavy taxation, children begging in the shadows of opulent temples, the quiet dignity of those who created beauty through craft rather than wealth.

During one such excursion, he had spent an entire afternoon watching a master glassblower create delicate vessels that rivaled any palace treasure. The artisan had invited the seemingly ordinary young man to try his hand at the craft, laughing good-naturedly at Aethen's clumsy attempts. That laughter—genuine, without deference or ulterior motive—had been more precious to the prince than any courtier's elaborate compliment.

"Your Highness," Trell's voice pulled him from his reverie. "The trackers have found something."

Ahead, the lead tracker was gesturing toward a thicket where fresh earth had been churned. "Rooting signs, Your Highness," the man explained. "A large boar passed through here not long ago." He pointed to a tree where bark had been stripped away at tusk-height. "A male, and a big one. Likely feeding in the clearing beyond."

Lord Brennan's eyes gleamed with anticipation. "Excellent. We should dismount and proceed on foot. The ground is too uneven for safe riding."

Aethen complied, handing his mare's reins to a squire. He accepted the ornate hunting spear Trell offered—a ceremonial weapon that had been in the royal family for generations, its shaft inlaid with silver depicting scenes from Allemarea's founding. The prince ran his fingers over the metalwork, appreciating the artistry while dreading its intended use.

"Your Highness should remain toward the center of the formation," Trell suggested quietly. "For safety."

"And so others might claim the kill before I embarrass myself?" Aethen replied with a wry smile.

Trell's weathered face remained impassive, though his eyes crinkled slightly. "I merely follow protocol, Your Highness."

"Of course you do," Aethen said, patting the older man's shoulder. "Lead on, then."

The hunting party spread out in practiced formation, moving cautiously through the undergrowth. Aethen followed Trell's guidance, staying behind the more eager hunters. The forest had grown quieter, birds falling silent in anticipation of violence.

As they approached the clearing, Aethen found his attention drawn to a shaft of sunlight illuminating a cluster of wood violets—their delicate blue petals a perfect counterpoint to the dappled golden light. He paused, mentally composing a sketch he would create later, noting how the flowers' hue reminded him of Daecillaea's sacred waters that flowed through Allemarea's great waterfall.

His momentary distraction proved catastrophic.

The sudden baying of hounds and shouted warnings jerked him back to awareness. The forest seemed to explode with movement as an enormous boar—far larger than anticipated—burst through the undergrowth directly toward him, its tusks gleaming wickedly, small eyes filled with fury. Its charge had scattered the forward hunters, and now it had found a new target.

Time slowed. Aethen raised his spear, assuming the defensive stance he'd been taught since childhood. The beast was less than fifteen paces away, closing rapidly. He braced himself, aiming for the vital spot just behind the creature's shoulder.

"Your Highness! Move!" Trell's voice seemed distant.

Nine paces. Seven. The boar's massive bulk powered forward with surprising speed. Aethen held his ground, knowing that fleeing would only guarantee being taken from behind. Five paces. He adjusted his grip, preparing for impact.

The spear caught the boar squarely, but the creature's momentum was far greater than Aethen had anticipated. The shaft shuddered violently in his hands. For a moment, he thought the ancient weapon would hold—then came a sharp crack as the ornate spear shattered, centuries-old wood giving way.

Pain exploded across Aethen's side as one of the boar's tusks found purchase, ripping through his hunting leathers and into flesh. The impact sent him sprawling backward, landing hard against a fallen tree. The boar, wounded but not fatally, wheeled around for another charge.

Through a haze of shock and pain, Aethen witnessed beauty in the most unexpected place—the perfect arc of Trell's spear as it flew through dappled light, striking the boar mid-turn. The beast staggered, then collapsed mere paces from where Aethen lay.

Voices shouted. Hands pressed against his side, bringing fresh waves of agony. Aethen tried to focus, but his vision swam. He was dimly aware of being lifted, of urgent conversations happening around him.

"...bleeding heavily..."
"...wound is deep, possibly internal damage..."
"...won't survive the journey back to the palace..."

Curious detachment settled over him. He felt warm liquid soaking his side, spreading with alarming speed. The pain had transformed into a strange numbness that he knew, intellectually, was a dangerous sign.

"Your Highness, stay with us." Trell's face appeared above him, lined with worry. "Help is coming."

Aethen tried to respond but found his mouth uncooperative. Instead, he gazed upward, noticing how beautifully the canopy framed the sky above. If these were to be his last moments, at least they contained something worth seeing.

"The village of Merrow's Hollow is less than an hour's ride," someone was saying—Lord Brennan, his earlier impatience replaced by genuine concern. "They say there's a healer there, a woman with... unusual abilities. Miraculous, some claim."

"Superstitious nonsense," countered another voice. "We need to get him back to the palace physicians."

"Look at him!" Brennan snapped. "He won't survive the journey to the palace. Do you want to explain to Queen Iolara how her only son died in your company?"

The mere mention of his mother's name seemed to chill the air. Aethen had a fleeting vision of Iolara's cold fury if he died on this hunting trip she had insisted upon—a bitter irony that might have made him laugh if he could have mustered the strength.

Trell's authoritative voice cut through the argument. "Merrow's Hollow it is. Brennan, Asten, help me secure His Highness for transport. Valyn, ride ahead—find this healer and bring her to meet us on the road if possible. Every moment counts."

Aethen felt himself being carefully lifted onto a makeshift litter. The movement sent fresh pain lancing through his side, drawing an involuntary gasp from his lips.

"Forgive us, Your Highness," Trell murmured, securing straps to minimize movement. "We must move quickly."

As consciousness began to slip away, Aethen's artist's eye caught one final detail—a small blue butterfly landing briefly on his blood-soaked hand before fluttering away. In his fading thoughts, he found it curiously significant, this moment of delicate beauty amid violence and pain.

Then darkness claimed him.

* * *

Valyn, youngest son of House Meroth and the fastest rider among the hunting party, drove his horse mercilessly toward Merrow's Hollow. His mind raced faster than his mount, calculating the horrifying implications of Prince Aethen's injury. If the heir to Allemarea died during a simple hunting expedition, the consequences would extend far beyond personal grief.

The succession would be thrown into chaos. Queen Iolara's brothers would press their claims. Neighboring kingdoms might sense weakness and test borders. And those responsible for the prince's safety—himself included—would face the queen's legendary wrath. He had witnessed her coldness when displeased with minor matters; her fury over her son's death would be apocalyptic.

These thoughts spurred him onward, pushing his lathered horse to greater speed. As he crested a hill, he saw smoke rising from the village ahead—cooking fires marking civilization in the wilderness. Relief surged briefly before anxiety returned. What if this fabled healer was merely a rural fraud? What if her supposed abilities were nothing but peasant superstition?

No matter. The prince needed any help available, however unlikely.

The village came into view—a modest collection of thatched buildings surrounding a central well. People stopped their morning activities to stare as Valyn thundered in, royal insignia clearly visible on his mud-spattered cloak. He reined his exhausted horse to a halt in what appeared to be the village center.

"I seek the healer!" he called out, voice carrying the unmistakable accent of Allemarean nobility. "Where can I find her? It's an emergency!"

Villagers exchanged glances, some with pride, others with uncertainty. An older woman approached, her manner suggesting authority despite her simple clothing.

"What business have you with our healer, sir?" she asked, voice respectful but cautious.

"Prince Aethen has been gravely injured in a hunting accident," Valyn explained, anxiety making his tone sharper than intended. "They bring him here now. His life hangs by a thread. We were told your village has a healer of... extraordinary skill."

Murmurs spread through the gathering crowd. The woman's eyes widened slightly at the mention of royalty.

"You speak of Healer Naimente," she said, touching a small blue stone pendant at her throat—a healer's symbol. "I'm Elder Maren. I'll take you to her dwelling."

As they moved through the village, Valyn noted the unusual deference with which people spoke of this Naimente. Not merely respect, but something approaching reverence—or perhaps wariness. Interesting, but irrelevant if she couldn't save the prince.

"Is it true what they say about her healing abilities?" he asked the elder as they walked.

Maren's eyes flickered with an emotion Valyn couldn't quite identify—pride mingled with something that might have been concern. "Naimente has always been gifted, even as an apprentice. But recently..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "Recently her abilities have grown beyond what any of us thought possible."

"Grown how?" Valyn pressed.

"She healed Kerreth after a tree crushed him," offered a villager walking nearby. "Man should've been dead—ribs through his lungs and everything. She put her hands on him, and he walked home that same day."

"Old Thoman dances now," added another. "After thirty years barely able to walk."

Maren nodded but said nothing more, her expression guarded as they stopped before a modest hut distinguished by drying herbs hanging from the eaves. She knocked firmly on the door.

"Naimente," she called. "You're needed urgently."

The door opened to reveal a young woman with striking violet eyes that caught Valyn off guard. She wore simple clothing, her dark hair practically braided, a wrapped left hand resting atop a mortar and pestle she'd apparently been using. Despite her humble appearance, something about her presence commanded attention—a quiet confidence that seemed almost regal.

"What's happened, Elder Maren?" she asked, her gaze shifting to Valyn and taking in his royal insignia with a flash of interest that seemed different from the typical village response to nobility.

Valyn stepped forward, giving a perfunctory bow. "My lady, Prince Aethen Ael'Dae of Allemarea has been gravely injured in a hunting accident near your village. He's being brought here now, but his wounds are severe—a boar's tusk has opened his side to the bone, and he loses blood rapidly."

He watched her carefully, looking for signs of alarm or inadequacy. Instead, he saw her eyes sharpen with focus, her posture straightening almost imperceptibly. She set aside her work with deliberate calm that spoke of complete confidence.

"How far away is he?" she asked, already gathering items into a satchel.

"Less than an hour, coming from the western forest path," Valyn replied. "Captain Trell suggested you might meet them on the road, if possible."

She nodded, continuing her preparations with practiced efficiency. "I'll need a horse."

"Take mine," the elder woman offered. "It's saddled behind my dwelling."

"Thank you, Maren." Naimente turned to a young woman who had appeared in the doorway—dark-haired and serious-eyed. "Maiya, prepare the hut for a serious injury. Fresh bandages, hot water, and clear the table for examination."

"Yes, Healer," the girl responded, with a quick glance of curiosity at Valyn before disappearing inside.

Naimente finished gathering supplies, her movements unhurried yet wasting no motion. Valyn found himself strangely reassured by her composure, though he reminded himself that confidence did not necessarily indicate competence.

As they walked toward the elder's home to collect the horse, Valyn felt compelled to emphasize the gravity of the situation.

"The Prince's injury is severe, healer. I've seen men die from less. If you're uncertain of your abilities—"

Naimente's violet eyes met his, and for an instant, Valyn thought he saw a flicker of crimson in their depths—a trick of the morning light, surely.

"I've saved men others had given up for dead, sir," she replied, her voice carrying absolute certainty. "If there's breath in his body when I reach him, your prince will live."

Something in her tone—not bravado but simple conviction—silenced further doubt. As she mounted the horse with surprising grace for a village healer, Valyn found himself actually believing her extraordinary claim.

"Show me where," she said, gathering the reins.

As Valyn remounted his tired horse to lead the way, he noticed Naimente adjust a strip of linen wrapped around her left palm. A slight smile played across her face—not of anxiety or concern, but something that looked almost like anticipation.

* * *

Naimente felt Tarashren's power stir within her as she rode toward the injured prince. This was no coincidence; this was opportunity—a chance to demonstrate her abilities beyond her village, to prove herself to those who might otherwise never know her name. After years of limited resources and preventable deaths, after the painful loss of Lyra and countless others, she would finally show what true healing could accomplish.

The flame mark on her palm throbbed warmly beneath its wrapping, almost like a heartbeat matching her own excitement. She unconsciously stroked the bandage with her thumb, taking comfort in the connection to her power's source.

She thought of her conversation with Aedil, of the older healer's warnings and fears. *Fire without water burns unchecked*, the elder had cautioned. But what Aedil failed to understand was that Naimente's fire was controlled, directed, purposeful. It burned to heal, not destroy.

Saving a prince—that would silence doubts. That would prove her path was righteous. That would demonstrate the value of embracing new powers rather than clinging to traditions that allowed suffering to persist.

The royal messenger rode ahead, occasionally glancing back as if to reassure himself that she followed. His initial skepticism had been obvious in his tone, his bearing, the way he'd looked at her humble dwelling. Yet even he had seemed swayed by her confidence. Soon all of them would witness what she could do. Soon they would understand.

As they crested a hill, she saw the hunting party in the distance—a somber procession centered around a makeshift litter carried between two horses. Even from afar, she could see the gravity in their movements, the urgency in their pace.

The mark on her palm flared with heat, not painfully but eagerly, ready to channel power that would astonish these noblemen, ready to save a life they believed forfeit. Ready to prove, beyond any doubt, that Naimente Kamame was no ordinary healer but something entirely new.

She thought briefly of Maiya—Lyra's sister—preparing the hut back in the village. How fitting that on this day when everything would change, her connection to the child she couldn't save remained part of her story. Today she would succeed where once she had failed. Today death would retreat before her power.

"There's still time," she murmured, urging her borrowed horse forward. "There's still time to change everything."

The rising sun caught her face as she rode, illuminating eyes that now permanently held that subtle crimson tint—barely perceptible unless one knew to look for it. Behind her, the village of Merrow's Hollow fell away, soon to become merely the first chapter in the story of her ascent.
