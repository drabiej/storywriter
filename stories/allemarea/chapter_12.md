## CHAPTER 12: DREAMS OF WATER AND FIRE

Naevyn thrashed in his bed, tangled in sweat-dampened sheets. Water closed over his head, dark and endless—but unlike the nightmares that had plagued him since watching his childhood friend Talon disappear beneath the river's surface, this drowning felt different.

He wasn't fighting. He wasn't afraid.

The water embraced him like a mother welcoming home a long-absent child. Instead of burning lungs and panic, he felt recognition—as though the liquid surrounding him was not his enemy but a part of himself he had long denied. Through crystalline blue depths, patterns formed and dissolved—ancient symbols that seemed familiar though he had never consciously seen them before.

*Naevyn*, a voice called, neither male nor female but resonant with authority. *You have denied me too long.*

He tried to respond but had no breath, no voice underwater. Yet somehow, his thoughts carried.

*I fear you*, he admitted. *I have always feared you.*

*Yet you seek me even now*, the voice replied, gentle despite its power. *Through scrolls and histories, through myths and legends. You circle my truth without embracing it.*

The water around him began to glow with soft blue luminescence. In its light, he saw a feminine form taking shape—not fully humanoid, but flowing and changing like the element itself.

*You are Daecillaea*, he realized.

*I am what your kind has named me*, she acknowledged. *But I am older than names. I was here when the mountains were young, when fire and water danced in balance rather than opposition. Before your kind forgot.*

Images flashed through the water—elemental forces shaping the land in harmony, great works emerging from their balanced interaction, humans honoring an ancient pact between opposing powers.

*He rises again*, she continued, her luminous form darkening. *My brother-opposite. My necessary balance. But he comes not in harmony but in vengeance, twisted by diminishment and neglect.*

*Tarashren*, Naevyn thought, the name bubbling from his mind like air escaping drowning lungs.

*Yes. He seeks through his vessel what was denied him—dominion rather than partnership. If he succeeds, all will burn, and even I cannot restore what will be lost.*

*What can I do?* Naevyn asked, surprising himself with the question.

*Remember*, she answered. *Find what was hidden. Gather those who still listen. Stand against the flame not with force but with truth.*

Her form began dissolving back into the surrounding waters.

*Why me?* he called in desperation. *I'm just a scholar. I fear your very essence.*

Her answer came as the dream began to fade: *Because you have always been mine, Naevyn Daecilrith. Even in your fear. Perhaps because of it.*

Naevyn awoke with a gasp, but not the panicked gulping for air that usually accompanied his water nightmares. Instead, he felt clarity and purpose. The room around him seemed sharper somehow—the blue tapestries more intense, the distant sound of water more musical.

He rose immediately and crossed to his desk, adjusting his spectacles before lighting a lamp and pulling his journal from its leather case. With hands that barely trembled, he recorded every detail of the dream—the symbols, the words spoken, the sense of ancient power and urgent warning.

As he wrote, he noticed something strange. Droplets of water had formed on his skin, though the room was not particularly warm. They beaded on his arms like dew, yet when he touched one experimentally, it seemed to sink into his flesh, leaving a momentary coolness and a faint, bluish shimmer that faded almost instantly.

"Curious," he murmured, making a note of this manifestation as well. He touched his bad leg absently, feeling the old ache that always accompanied moments of uncertainty.

Throughout his academic career, he had maintained the skeptical distance expected of a Korian scholar. Myths were cultural artifacts to be analyzed, not literal truths to be believed. Yet now he found himself facing the possibility that the Furies were actual entities—ancient, powerful, and currently engaged in a struggle that threatened the region.

"Water shows what fire hides," he said aloud, the phrase rising unbidden to his lips—words he had never consciously known yet somehow remembered.

As the first light of dawn broke, Naevyn dressed with uncharacteristic haste. There were archives to search, references to cross-check, patterns to identify. For the first time in his scholarly career, knowledge felt not like an end in itself but a weapon he was being called to wield.

* * *

The Allemarean Royal Archives occupied the lowest level of the eastern palace wing, a labyrinthine collection of chambers filled with records dating back to the kingdom's founding. Unlike the meticulously organized Great Library of Kor, the archives followed a system comprehensible only to its caretakers—a fact that had frustrated Naevyn during his previous visits.

"These are quite unusual requests, Scholar Daecilrith," Archivist Merrold commented as he led Naevyn through narrow passages between towering shelves. "Pre-founding mythological texts, accounts of ancient elemental conflicts, the original Covenant of Waters... not typical diplomatic research materials."

"Scholarly curiosity," Naevyn replied, touching his spectacles in his characteristic gesture. "The Forum has authorized a comparative study of founding myths across the region. Understanding cultural foundations helps foster more effective relations."

The archivist's skeptical expression suggested he wasn't convinced, but the weight of gold in his pocket apparently outweighed his doubts. "Here we are," he said, stopping before a recessed alcove protected by a finely wrought iron gate. "The Ancestral Collection. Materials dating from before Allemarea's formal establishment, some allegedly from the Manaerian period."

Once alone, Naevyn methodically examined the ancient texts, his trained eye quickly sorting genuine antiquities from later reproductions. Many were written in archaic dialects of Ruinekarian that would challenge even specialist linguists, but Naevyn's extensive language training allowed him to decipher the essential content.

Hours passed as he immersed himself in accounts of the world's formation. Common across these narratives were references to primordial entities called Soluived and Verdanivel, described variously as "the First Ones," "the Shapers," or "the Divided Whole."

According to the texts, Soluived and Verdanivel had once been a single entity that split itself to create the world—one representing order, preservation, and structure; the other embodying chaos, transformation, and change. From their division came the Furies—elemental manifestations including Tarashren of fire, Daecillaea of water, Vormenil of earth, and Selaphine of air.

But one passage captured Naevyn's complete attention—a fragmentary text written on brittle vellum in a dialect so archaic he struggled to translate certain passages:

*Before the fall of sacred Kor, when the Covenant still held between opposed powers, the balance maintained prosperity. But Tarashren, beloved of Verdanivel, grew jealous of Daecillaea's waters being honored above his flame. In his wrath, he broke the ancient pact, sending fire to consume what water protected.*

*Seven days the skies burned. Seven nights the waters boiled. When balance was finally restored, the golden city of Kor was no more—transformed to barren waste that would become the Ashanar Desert.*

*Thus the First Sundering. Thus the exile of the Korian survivors to establish new lands far from their ruined home. Thus the beginning of the Age of Diminished Powers, when Furies once worshipped became myths whispered by the fearful.*

Naevyn sat back, pulse racing. This account directly contradicted everything he had learned about Kor's history. The official narrative taught to every Korian child described the founding of their republic after a natural disaster—a drought so severe it forced migration from their original homeland. No mention of elemental conflicts, broken covenants, or ancient entities.

His research continued with increasing urgency, uncovering references to "vessels" or "vessels of fury"—humans who became conduits for elemental powers. Such vessels gained tremendous abilities but often lost themselves in the process, their humanity gradually subsumed by the elemental force they channeled.

A fragile scroll contained a simple sketch: a human figure with skin cracked like cooling lava, glowing from within. Beside it was written: "The final transformation. When flesh becomes vessel completely."

The implication was terrifying. If Naimente was indeed becoming Tarashren's vessel, the consequences would extend far beyond political instability. According to these accounts, the entire region faced potential devastation comparable to whatever cataclysm had created the Ashanar Desert.

As Naevyn gathered his notes, a small blue book caught his attention—so slim it had been wedged between larger volumes and nearly overlooked. Its cover bore no title, only a stylized water drop similar to the pendant he'd noticed Eilene wearing at the wedding.

Inside, he found ritual instructions—methods for communicating with Daecillaea, for channeling water's influence, and most importantly, for counteracting fire's dominance:

*When fire's vessel rises, water must find its own. Not through force but through willing acceptance. Not through dominance but through partnership. The vessel of water accepts rather than controls, embraces rather than commands. This is its strength and its defense against flame's consumption.*

As he read these words, Naevyn felt a strange coolness spread through his body again—a sensation both foreign and eerily familiar. The implications were simultaneously terrifying and illuminating.

His water dreams. His scholarly interest in Daecillaea despite his fear. His posting to Allemarea at this precise moment. The patterns suggested a purpose he had never consciously chosen yet had been moving toward his entire life.

Closing the book, he carefully secreted it inside his jacket. His rational mind still searched for alternative explanations, but the weight of evidence was becoming difficult to dismiss. Whatever was happening transcended conventional political concerns—though it would certainly have political consequences if Allemarea's new queen was indeed becoming a vessel for an ancient fire entity bent on destruction.

He needed allies—people with different perspectives and resources who might help him piece together this puzzle. The merchant princess from Arnekol, with her blue pendant and calculating mind, seemed a logical first contact.

* * *

In her private chambers within the Tarthenian embassy, Crown Princess Rin Tarthan knelt on a simple reed mat. Her armor had been replaced by a plain red robe, her only adornment the ancestral medallion worn by all Tarthenian royalty during sacred rituals. Before her burned a single candle, its flame perfectly still in the windless room.

Tarthenian meditation was a martial discipline—a method of focusing the warrior's mind, honing awareness, and connecting with ancestral wisdom. Where others sought detachment, Tarthenian warriors sought intensity of presence, a heightened perception that served them in battle and leadership alike.

Rin's breathing followed the ancient pattern—seven counts in, hold for three, seven counts out. With each cycle, her awareness extended further beyond her physical form, perceiving first the room around her, then the embassy building, then the city beyond.

Today, however, something interfered with the familiar practice. As her awareness reached toward the city's edges, where Allemarea's magnificent waterfall should have dominated her perception, she encountered resistance—a wavering heat haze that distorted her mental vision.

She adjusted her breathing, deepening her focus. The interference intensified. The heat haze coalesced into coherent images—flames rising from the waterfall itself, water turning to steam, the cascade diminishing until only fire remained, spreading outward to consume the surrounding forests and fields.

The vision shifted. Now she saw Naimente standing atop the royal tower, arms outstretched, commanding the flames. But Naimente herself was changing—her skin cracking to reveal molten heat beneath, her violet eyes now burning crimson, her human form merely a shell containing something ancient and terrible.

Behind Naimente, barely visible through smoke and flame, stood another figure—massive, elemental, more presence than physical form. It seemed to both envelope and emerge from Naimente, using her as its gateway into the world.

The medallion at Rin's throat grew painfully hot, breaking her concentration. Her eyes snapped open, and she inhaled sharply, uncharacteristically disturbed. During two decades of martial meditation, she had occasionally received impressions or insights, but never anything so vivid or alarming.

She touched the medallion, finding it cool despite the burning sensation moments before. Rising in a single fluid motion, Rin moved to her writing desk and penned a terse message to her father:

*Father,*

*Ancestral meditation reveals accelerating threat. Fire entity working through Allemarean queen. Waterfall diminishing. Expect major conflagration within two seasonal turns. Request immediate military readiness and activation of Mountain Covenant protocols.*

*Will continue observation and seek alliance with others who recognize the threat. Korian diplomat Naevyn Daecilrith shows awareness beyond his official capacity. Merchant Princess Eilene Anadrui likewise perceives patterns beyond the obvious.*

*In service to throne and land,*
*Rin*

She sealed the message with her signet ring and summoned her most trusted guard.

"This goes directly to the King's hand," she instructed. "No intermediaries. Fastest horse, shortest route, no stops except to change mounts."

The guard departed immediately, understanding the urgency without requiring explanation.

Alone again, Rin moved to the window overlooking Allemarea's central plaza. From this vantage, she could see the royal palace and, in the distance, the upper portion of the great waterfall. Even at this distance, the waters had diminished noticeably since her arrival. What had once been a thundering cascade now seemed little more than a substantial stream.

More telling were the subtle changes in the city itself. People moved with unconscious urgency, as though responding to pressure they couldn't identify. The famous blue banners of Allemarea, traditionally kept pristine to honor Daecillaea, now hung slightly faded and dusty. And most concerning, new decorative braziers had appeared throughout the palace grounds, their flames burning unnecessarily bright even in daylight.

"The battlefield is being prepared," she murmured, touching her sword hilt. "But most don't yet realize they stand upon it."

* * *

Naimente stood alone in her private chamber, concentrating on the small flame dancing above her outstretched palm. What had once required intense focus now happened almost without conscious thought—fire responding to her will, eager and obedient.

Yet something had changed. The flame no longer simply obeyed; it anticipated, sometimes acting before her conscious command. Worse, it responded to her emotions in ways she hadn't intended, flaring with her irritation or frustration.

Earlier that morning, during a meeting with agricultural ministers, she had found herself annoyed by their blind adherence to traditional planting schedules despite changing climate patterns. Without conscious intent, the candles in the council chamber had suddenly flared three feet high, singeing the ceiling hangings and sending ministers scrambling in panic.

She had laughed it off, claiming a strange draft, but the incident troubled her. Control was essential to her plans. Risks like these could expose her before she had consolidated enough power to withstand opposition.

Now she practiced, attempting to regain precision. The flame above her palm obediently formed shapes at her command—a flower, a bird, a leaping deer. But when she tried to extinguish it completely, it merely diminished to a stubborn ember that refused to die.

"Curious," she murmured, closing her fist to smother the flame. A sharp pain shot through her palm, and she opened her hand to find the flame mark glowing brightly, pulsing like a second heartbeat.

She closed her eyes, reaching inward for the connection that had become simultaneously more powerful and less distinct. Once, communicating with Tarashren had required specific ritual and concentration. Now his presence lingered constantly at the edges of her awareness, like heat shimmer above summer roads.

*I need better control*, she projected into that heat-presence. *These incidents risk everything we've worked for.*

The response came not in words but in sensations—amusement, confidence, hunger. Images flashed through her mind: fire consuming a forest, leaving fertile ash for new growth; a smith's hammer shaping metal through destructive force; a fever burning away disease to restore health.

*Destruction before renewal*, the impressions seemed to say. *Why fear the necessary cleansing?*

"Because timing matters," she answered aloud, frustration evident. "Expose too much too soon, and they'll move against us before we're ready."

The response felt dismissive—flames cannot be contained forever; pressure builds until vessels crack; transformation follows its own timeline, not human preference.

The mark on her palm flared again, pain shooting up her arm and into her chest. She gasped, doubling over as heat spread through her veins like molten metal. Her reflection in the mirror caught her attention—her eyes glowing crimson, small fissures appearing on her cheeks and neck, revealing fiery light beneath her skin before healing almost instantly.

The transformation lasted only seconds before subsiding, leaving her breathless and shaken. These physical manifestations appearing without her conscious control were new—transforming her visibly in ways she could not hide.

A knock at the door startled her. "Who is it?" she called, quickly checking her reflection.

"It's Aethen, my love. May I enter? I have something to show you."

She composed herself. "Of course."

Aethen entered carrying a large portfolio of drawings and a rolled canvas. His face lit with boyish enthusiasm, a welcome contrast to the troubled thoughts occupying her mind. Despite everything, his genuine affection still touched something in her—a reminder of the healer she had been, the woman who had wanted simply to do good before ambition and Tarashren's influence had expanded her vision.

"I've completed a new series," he explained, carefully opening the portfolio on her desk. "Though I confess they're rather different from my usual work. I'm not entirely sure what inspired them."

Naimente examined the drawings with growing unease. Where Aethen typically produced gentle landscapes and delicate portraits, these images depicted Allemarea's waterfall transformed—waters turning to steam, flames rising from the cascade itself, the surrounding land scorched and barren. In one particularly disturbing sketch, the royal palace stood silhouetted against a backdrop of fire, with a figure on its highest tower directing the flames like a conductor leading an orchestra.

Though the figure's face wasn't detailed, there was something in its stance that suggested herself.

"These are... quite striking," she managed, keeping her tone neutral. "A departure from your usual themes."

"I know." He frowned, running a hand through his hair in a characteristic gesture of confusion. "They've been coming to me in dreams—so vivid I must sketch them immediately upon waking. I don't understand their meaning, but they feel important somehow."

He unrolled the canvas, revealing a larger, more detailed painting of the waterfall. In this version, the waters had almost completely disappeared, replaced by a column of flame. But most disturbing was the face he had painted within the fire—not human but elemental, ancient and terrible, with an expression of triumph.

"I call this one 'The Awakening,'" Aethen said softly. "Though I don't know what awakens or why it fills me with such dread."

Naimente stared at the painted face, recognition chilling her despite the heat still lingering in her veins. Though she had never seen Tarashren in physical form, the entity depicted captured perfectly the presence she felt during their communion—ancient, powerful, consuming.

"It's very powerful," she said carefully. "Have you shown these to anyone else?"

"No." Aethen looked up with unexpected sharpness in his usually gentle eyes. "Something told me they should remain private for now. People might misinterpret them, might see them as..."

"As what?" she prompted when he hesitated.

"As warning," he finished, his voice dropping. "Though against what, I couldn't say."

He began gathering the drawings, his movements precise and careful. "What troubles me most is that I enjoy creating these dark images. There's an exhilaration in rendering destruction that I've never felt when painting beauty. It disturbs me, this pleasure in depicting devastation."

Naimente watched him work, reevaluating her husband yet again. The glimpses of perception beneath his compliant exterior were becoming more frequent, more unsettling. Was Tarashren's influence affecting him through their connection? Or was some part of Aethen responding independently to the changing elemental balance?

"Perhaps it's simply artistic growth," she suggested. "Exploring new themes, new emotions."

"Perhaps." He didn't sound convinced. Rolling up the last sketch, he added, "The strangest part is that I feel compelled to paint these scenes, as though someone else guides my hand. Yet they come from me—my technique, my perspective. It's as if some part of me sees things my conscious mind refuses to acknowledge."

The insight was uncomfortably close to truth. Naimente moved to embrace him, partly from genuine affection, partly to hide her expression.

"Artists have always served as society's visionaries," she said against his shoulder. "Perhaps your dreams simply process the changes happening in Allemarea—my new reforms, the shifting political landscape."

He returned her embrace, but something in his posture suggested reservation. "Changes indeed," he murmured. "Though sometimes I wonder if they're the changes we intended."

He pulled back, smiling with apparent normalcy, though his eyes remained troubled. "I should prepare for the afternoon council session. They're discussing the new tax structure you proposed. I want to ensure it passes without amendments."

After he departed, Naimente returned to the painting he had left behind. The face in the flames seemed to watch her, evaluation in its ancient eyes. She touched the canvas, feeling a resonant heat respond to her fingers.

"What are you showing him?" she whispered.

For once, no response came—only the steady, uncomfortable pulsing of the flame mark on her palm, like a second heart beating out of rhythm with her own.

* * *

The Western Gardens provided a perfect location for discreet conversation—public enough to avoid suspicion, with enough private alcoves for confidential exchange. Naevyn had arranged to meet Eilene at a secluded bench near the medicinal herb section, where few courtiers ventured.

He arrived early, positioning himself with a scholarly text on comparative regional architecture—his official reason for seeking Eilene's perspective. She arrived precisely at the appointed time, her merchant's punctuality evident. The blue pendant he had noticed at the wedding hung at her throat, catching the light with unusual vividness against her elegant green gown.

"Scholar Daecilrith," she greeted him with a formal nod. "I understand you have questions about Arnekol's distinctive tower construction."

"Indeed, Merchant Princess," he replied, adjusting his spectacles. "The Forum values comprehensive cultural understanding. Architectural traditions offer particular insight into a region's historical development."

They maintained this pretense until a nearby gardener moved to a different section, leaving them relatively isolated. Even then, Eilene maintained the facade a moment longer before subtly shifting to more significant matters.

"I notice Allemarea's famous waterfall has diminished considerably since my arrival," she observed, her tone casual though her eyes were sharp. "Local merchants tell me it's unprecedented for this season."

"My research indicates the same," Naevyn agreed. "Historical records describe the waterfall's flow as remarkably consistent throughout the year—one reason for Allemarea's agricultural prosperity."

Eilene touched her pendant briefly—a gesture Naevyn had noticed during their previous interactions. "In Arnekol, we maintain extensive records of environmental patterns affecting trade routes. Consistent water flow means reliable transportation and predictable harvests. Disruptions to water systems typically precede broader economic instability."

"A logical correlation," Naevyn said carefully. "Though some might suggest the causality runs deeper than mere practical impacts."

"Some might," Eilene agreed, her gaze evaluating. "Those who study patterns beyond the immediately observable often recognize signs others dismiss."

Naevyn weighed his next words carefully. "I've recently uncovered historical texts suggesting Allemarea's founding was intimately connected to elemental forces personified in regional mythology. These accounts describe cycles of balance and imbalance with far-reaching consequences beyond symbolic significance."

Instead of skepticism, Eilene's expression showed cautious interest. "Arnekol's merchant histories contain similar references—typically dismissed as superstitious embellishments. Yet our oldest trade records include detailed protocols for responding to what they termed 'elemental disruptions.' These protocols remain in our archives, though they haven't been implemented in generations."

She leaned slightly closer. "The pendant you've noticed is one such artifact—traditionally worn by Arnekol's leader during periods of significant elemental imbalance. It's been in my family's possession for twelve generations, passed down with specific instructions for its use."

"And has your pendant... responded... to recent events?" Naevyn asked carefully.

Eilene hesitated, her merchant's pragmatism visibly warring with observations she could not easily dismiss. "It has behaved... unusually since my arrival in Allemarea. It grows uncommonly warm when I'm in Princess Naimente's presence, and occasionally seems to vibrate when near sources of water. Effects I would typically attribute to imagination or coincidence, except..."

"Except they correlate with other observations that form a coherent pattern," Naevyn finished.

She nodded once, decision made. "My trading house didn't achieve its position by ignoring patterns, however unusual. Data is data, regardless of its source or its conflict with established understanding."

From within his jacket, Naevyn withdrew the small blue book. "This text describes rituals for communicating with Daecillaea and contains references to 'vessels' through which elemental forces might manifest in human form."

Eilene took the book, examining it with a merchant's careful assessment. "The symbol on the cover matches my pendant," she noted. "And similar markings appear in Arnekol's oldest harbor structures—typically near water-control mechanisms."

She returned the book. "Let's speak plainly, Scholar Daecilrith. You believe Princess Naimente represents a manifestation of elemental fire, disrupting the region's historical balance. You suspect this threatens not just political stability but potentially the region's physical environment. And you're seeking allies who might recognize and respond to this threat."

"I believe the evidence points in that direction," Naevyn confirmed, touching his bad leg unconsciously. "My research suggests a similar elemental imbalance may have destroyed the original Korian homeland thousands of years ago, transforming what was once fertile land into the Ashanar Desert."

"A concerning historical precedent," Eilene said, her fingers calculating invisible numbers—a habit when processing complex variables. "And what response does your research suggest? Diplomatic pressure? Military intervention? Magical countermeasures from our own nonexistent elemental practitioners?"

The hint of dry humor in her last suggestion did not mask the practical concern beneath her question.

"The texts suggest water must find its own vessel to counterbalance fire's influence," he said. "Though how such a vessel is chosen or manifests remains unclear. More practically, I believe we need additional allies. Princess Rin of Tarthenia has shown awareness of unusual patterns, though I have not yet approached her directly."

"The warrior princess," Eilene mused. "A practical choice. Tarthenian traditions maintain stronger connections to ancient practices than most modern kingdoms. And should this situation deteriorate into physical conflict, military alliance would become essential."

"I propose we meet again with Princess Rin present," Eilene continued. "Three perspectives from three kingdoms provide a more complete assessment than either of us can achieve individually. The Tarthenian embassy maintains private reception rooms where conversations remain confidential—I have used them for sensitive trade negotiations previously."

"A sensible approach," Naevyn agreed. "Though we should maintain public diplomatic interactions to avoid drawing attention prematurely."

Eilene nodded, standing as though their discussion of architecture had concluded naturally. "I'll arrange the meeting through standard diplomatic channels—a cultural exchange regarding regional historical traditions. Innocuous enough to avoid suspicion."

As she prepared to depart, her expression shifted from calculated pragmatism to something more personal. "Scholar Daecilrith, I have built my career on evaluating patterns others miss or misinterpret. The merchant who succeeds sees connections between seemingly unrelated factors—weather in distant mountains affecting grain prices six months later, political tension in one kingdom creating trade opportunities in another."

She touched her pendant again. "What you're suggesting challenges every rational principle I value. Yet the pattern is too coherent, too consistent to dismiss. Whatever this is—elemental conflict, magical disruption, or something else entirely—it represents a threat to regional stability that extends beyond normal political concerns."

"I understand your reservation," Naevyn replied. "My Korian training emphasizes rational analysis and empirical evidence. These developments conflict with my scholarly foundations. Yet I cannot dismiss what I have observed and discovered merely because it contradicts my preconceptions."

"Then we find ourselves in rare agreement," Eilene said with the hint of a smile. "I will contact you when the meeting is arranged. Until then, maintain your scholarly inquiries. Knowledge remains our most valuable currency in uncertain times."

She departed along the garden path, her posture revealing nothing of their unusual conversation to any who might observe. Naevyn remained seated a while longer, ostensibly returning to his architectural text while his mind processed their exchange.

As the sun began its descent toward the western mountains, he finally rose to leave. He noticed something curious—the medicinal herbs surrounding the bench where they had sat, typically requiring regular watering in Allemarea's dry summer heat, looked unusually vibrant and healthy, their leaves glistening with moisture as though recently watered.

Yet no gardener had attended them during his hours in the garden, and no rain had fallen for days.

"Curious indeed," he murmured, touching one leaf experimentally. Water droplets clung to his fingers, cool and refreshing against his skin.

As he walked back toward the diplomatic quarter, he felt the weight of the small blue book in his pocket—both burden and potential salvation. He had committed himself to a path that diverged sharply from his carefully planned diplomatic career.

The question remaining was where that path might lead—and what he might become by following it.
