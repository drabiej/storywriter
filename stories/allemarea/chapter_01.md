## Chapter 1: THE HEALER'S GRIEF

The scent of willow bark and feverfew hung in the air, mingling with the metallic odor of blood and the sour smell of sickness. Naimente crushed more feverfew between her pestle and mortar, her movements precise despite the exhaustion that dragged at her limbs. She had been working without rest since dawn, when they had brought little Lyra to her hut, the child's small body burning with fever, her breathing labored and wet.

"Will she live?" Maiya asked, her voice barely above a whisper. The girl stood in the corner of the healer's hut, her hands twisting the worn fabric of her dress, eyes fixed on her younger sister's pale face.

Naimente's violet eyes—unusual in color and intensity—flickered to the older girl before returning to her work. She measured the crushed herbs with practiced precision, not a grain wasted. In Merrow's Hollow, nothing could be spared, especially not medicinal plants that took seasons to grow.

"I am doing everything within my power," Naimente said finally, her tone neither hopeful nor despairing but deliberate. She adjusted the herb mixture, adding a pinch of something from a carefully labeled clay jar. "Fetch more clean water from the spring—the last batch was clouded."

As Maiya hurried out, Naimente leaned closer to Lyra. The eight-year-old's chest rose and fell in shallow, irregular movements. Her skin was ashen beneath its fever flush, and her lips had taken on a bluish tinge that Naimente had seen too many times before. Death circled, waiting.

"Fight, little one," she whispered, placing a cool cloth on Lyra's forehead. "I've seen worse cases recover." The lie stuck in her throat, but she pushed past it. "Your sister needs you. Your mother needs you."

Through the small window, Naimente could see villagers returning from the fields, their backs bent with exhaustion, clothes patched and repatched. The spring planting demanded every able body if they were to avoid another winter of near-starvation. The village elder had exempted Naimente from field work years ago, recognizing that her healing skills were more valuable than another pair of hands in the soil.

A fact that did little to comfort her now, watching Lyra struggle for breath.

She turned back to her workbench, touching her temples briefly—a gesture that emerged whenever a problem defied her considerable knowledge. On the worn wooden surface lay her tools: knife, pestle, mortar, several spoons of different sizes, all meticulously clean despite their age and wear. Dried herbs hung from the rafters, organized by type and potency. Shelves lined the walls, holding dozens of labeled jars and bottles—the culmination of years collecting, experimenting, trading with traveling merchants for rare ingredients.

An impressive collection for a village healer, but painfully inadequate when faced with the lung sickness that had returned to Merrow's Hollow.

The door creaked open, and Aedil entered, her silver-streaked hair escaping its braid, her face lined with concern and age. The older woman had trained Naimente, recognizing the girl's potential when she was barely twelve. Now, at twenty-four, Naimente had surpassed her teacher in knowledge of herbs and healing techniques, though perhaps not in wisdom.

"I came as soon as I finished with Bram's leg," Aedil said, setting down a small basket of fresh herbs. "The infection is receding, thank the waters." She approached the bed, her experienced eyes taking in Lyra's condition. Her weathered face fell. "Ah, child. The lung sickness again."

"The third case this month," Naimente confirmed, her voice steady though her hands worked with increasing urgency. "I've tried the willow bark for fever, feverfew for inflammation, honey and thyme for the cough." She gestured to various bottles and bundles arranged on her worktable. "I've even prepared the red moss infusion you taught me last winter."

"And bloodletting?" Aedil asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.

Naimente's jaw tightened. "I don't believe draining her further will help. She's already too weak." She continued mixing her newest remedy with renewed focus, as if by concentrating hard enough, she could will it to succeed where others had failed.

A shadow passed over Aedil's face—disappointment, perhaps, or concern. "Sometimes the old ways are best, Naimente."

"And sometimes they kill as surely as the disease," Naimente replied, more sharply than she intended. She sighed, touching her temples again. "Forgive me. I'm tired."

"We all are, child." Aedil's voice held no rebuke, only understanding tinged with caution. "But we must work with what the land provides."

"What the land withholds, you mean," Naimente murmured, too quietly for Aedil to hear. She had organized last autumn's harvest distribution herself, ensuring fair shares and setting aside seeds for spring. She had created the village's first medicine exchange with neighboring communities. She had done everything possible within the constraints of their poverty—and still, children died of curable diseases.

Maiya returned with fresh water, her eyes darting anxiously between the two healers. Unlike her sister, she had her mother's practical nature and sturdy build. At fourteen, she already helped organize the younger children during planting and carried her share of the village's burdens.

"Is there news from Allemarea?" she asked, handing the water to Naimente. "About the lung sickness? Mother says the royal physicians have cures for all manner of ills."

Naimente exchanged a glance with Aedil. The capital city of Allemarea, with its gleaming spires and grand waterfall blessed by the Blue Fury Daecillaea, might as well have been in another world. News traveled slowly to Merrow's Hollow, and royal physicians certainly didn't concern themselves with the ailments of peasant children.

"The royal physicians keep their knowledge close," Naimente said, measuring her words carefully. "But I have my own knowledge, and I haven't given up."

As the evening deepened into night, more villagers gathered outside the healer's hut. They came after completing their work, bringing small offerings—a handful of early spring greens, a few precious eggs, prayers and well-wishes. Not out of obligation, but genuine respect for Naimente, who had delivered their babies, set their broken bones, eased their elders' final moments.

Lyra's mother, Senna, arrived last, her face etched with fear and exhaustion. She collapsed beside her daughter's bed, taking the small, hot hand between her calloused fingers.

"Save her," she whispered to Naimente. "Please. She's all I have besides Maiya."

Naimente nodded, the weight of those words pressing on her like a stone. "I'm preparing something stronger now." She returned to her workbench and opened a small, locked box hidden beneath it. From within, she withdrew three vials containing her most precious ingredients, reserved for the most desperate cases: three drops of imported argan oil, rare star anise, and the last of her calamus root. The mixture had cured a similar case two summers ago, though the patient had been older and stronger than Lyra.

Aedil watched her, eyebrows raised. "You're using your reserves."

"What else are they for, if not this?" Naimente replied, her concentration absolute as she prepared the medicine. Her hands moved with the confidence of someone who had memorized the healing properties of hundreds of plants, who could identify subtle variations in symptoms that others might miss.

"Lift her head," she instructed Senna, bringing the mixture to Lyra's lips. "She needs to swallow as much as possible."

Together they managed to get most of the medicine down the child's throat. Lyra coughed weakly, her eyes fluttering but not opening. Naimente checked her pulse—thready and rapid, but still fighting.

"Now we wait," she said, her voice revealing none of the doubt that gnawed at her.

The hours crept by. Villagers drifted away to their own homes, their own troubles. Only Senna, Maiya, and Aedil remained, keeping vigil with Naimente. Near midnight, Lyra's breathing changed, becoming more labored, with longer pauses between each intake of air.

Naimente felt a familiar hollowness spreading through her chest. She had lost patients before—the elderly, the badly injured, even children—but each death carved something out of her. Each represented a failure, a limit to her knowledge and skill that she refused to accept.

She bent over Lyra once more, pressing her ear to the child's chest, listening to the weakening struggle of her lungs. She straightened, decision made. From another hidden compartment in her workbench, she withdrew a small stone vial sealed with wax—a tincture she had acquired at great cost from a traveling apothecary, said to be made from flowers that grew only on the highest peaks.

"Naimente," Aedil cautioned, recognizing what she held. "That's untested. She may be too weak for such a potent remedy."

"She's dying anyway," Naimente replied, her violet eyes fierce in the lamplight. "I won't stand by and do nothing when there's still a chance."

"There's a difference between doing nothing and doing harm," Aedil warned, but made no move to stop her former apprentice. "Some battles cannot be won, no matter our skill or determination."

"I don't accept that," Naimente said quietly, breaking the wax seal. The pungent aroma filled the small hut—sharp, foreign, powerful. She carefully measured three drops onto Lyra's tongue.

For a moment—one heart-stopping moment—Lyra's breathing seemed to ease, and color returned to her lips.

"See?" Naimente whispered, more to herself than to Aedil. "It's working."

But the improvement was fleeting, a final rally before the inevitable. Lyra's breathing grew more ragged, and her small body began to tremble. Senna clutched her daughter's hand, tears streaming down her weathered face. Maiya stood frozen, her young face a mask of disbelief.

"No," Naimente murmured, reaching for another remedy, another tool, another chance. "No, I can save her. I know I can—"

And then it happened. Lyra's eyes flew open, staring not at her mother or sister, but directly at Naimente. For a heartbeat, the violet-eyed healer saw something impossible: a crimson flash, bright as embers, illuminating the child's eyes from within. The color blazed with unnatural intensity before receding like dying coals. Lyra's cracked lips parted, and in a voice that seemed too clear, too strong for her failing body, she whispered:

"The fire waits for you."

The words hung in the air like smoke. Then Lyra's eyes closed, her chest fell, and did not rise again.

Silence filled the hut, broken only by Senna's keening wail and Maiya's choked sobs. Naimente stood motionless, the unused remedy still in her hand, her mind replaying what she had just witnessed. The crimson flash, the unnatural strength in that final whisper, the cryptic words—had she imagined them? Was it merely the hallucination of an exhausted mind?

"Naimente." Aedil's voice brought her back to the moment. The older healer touched her arm gently. "You did everything possible—more than most would have attempted."

"It wasn't enough," Naimente said, her voice hollow. The stone vial slipped from her fingers, shattering on the packed earth floor. No one moved to clean it up.

She stepped back, allowing Senna her grief, watching as the woman gathered her dead child in her arms, rocking back and forth, her cries raw and primal. Maiya stood beside them, tears streaming silently down her face, her eyes meeting Naimente's across the room—not accusing, but questioning. Why couldn't you save her? What good is knowledge if it cannot prevent this?

Naimente had no answers.

Later, after Lyra's body had been prepared for burial and Senna and Maiya had been taken to rest at a neighbor's home, Naimente stood alone outside her hut. The night was clear, stars scattered like salt across the dark sky. In the distance, beyond fields and forests, the faint glow of Allemarea's lights painted the horizon—a reminder of another world, one of wealth and knowledge and power.

Naimente's fingers worked unconsciously, sorting invisible herbs, measuring imaginary remedies—a habit that emerged whenever her mind was troubled. She had organized three successful harvest distributions. She had created the village's first medicinal garden. She had improved the preparation of winter stores, reducing spoilage by half. All complex problems she had solved through intelligence and determination.

But she couldn't save one child from a disease that, in Allemarea, might be cured with a single dose of the right medicine.

"You should rest," Aedil said, emerging from the hut with two steaming cups of herbal tea. She handed one to Naimente. "Tomorrow will bring new patients, new challenges."

"And the same limitations," Naimente replied, her gaze fixed on the distant lights. "The same inadequate tools, the same insufficient knowledge."

Aedil sighed, the sound weary with the weight of years spent fighting similar battles. "That is the healer's burden. We cannot save everyone. Death is part of the pattern of life."

"It doesn't have to be," Naimente said, her voice suddenly intense. She turned to face her mentor, violet eyes gleaming in the moonlight. "Not like this—not these needless, preventable deaths. In Allemarea, they have medicines we've never seen, techniques we've never learned. Their healers don't watch children die of lung sickness while royal courtiers sip imported wines."

"The world is as it is," Aedil said, her tone gentle but firm. "We do what we can with what we have, where we are."

"And if that's not enough?" Naimente's hands curled into fists at her sides. "Do we simply accept it? Do we tell mothers like Senna that their children must die because we lack what those in power hoard for themselves?"

Aedil studied her former apprentice, concern etching deeper lines into her weathered face. "I recognize that look, Naimente. I've seen it before—that hunger for greater power to do good. It's a noble desire." She paused, choosing her next words carefully. "But beware ambition that springs from grief. It can lead to dangerous paths."

"Is it ambition to want better tools? More knowledge? The power to truly heal?" Naimente shook her head, frustration burning in her chest. "I'm tired of watching people die when they shouldn't have to."

"As am I," Aedil said softly. "But I've lived long enough to learn that power always comes with a price. And those who seek it most desperately often pay most dearly." She touched the blue stone pendant she wore—a symbol of Daecillaea, though few in the village still observed the old ways. "The Furies taught us that lesson long ago, if the stories are true."

Naimente fell silent, turning back to gaze at the distant lights of Allemarea. Lyra's final words echoed in her mind: The fire waits for you. She shivered despite the mild night air, unable to shake the memory of that crimson flash, that unnaturally clear voice.

"Get some rest," Aedil said after a long moment, touching Naimente's shoulder gently. "Grief clouds judgment, and you'll need your wits about you for the Miller twins' birthing—it could be any day now."

Naimente nodded absently, still staring at the horizon. "I'll rest soon."

After Aedil had gone, Naimente remained, the cooling tea forgotten in her hand. In her mind, she saw Lyra's face, and behind it, the faces of others she had lost—old Torrin, whose heart had given out last winter; Bram's wife, who had died in childbirth despite Naimente's best efforts; little Donal, taken by the same lung sickness two years ago.

Each death a failure. Each a reminder of her limitations.

She lifted her free hand, studying her long, skilled fingers in the moonlight. These hands could mix remedies, set bones, stitch wounds—but they could not hold back death when it came calling. Not with the knowledge and tools available to her here, in this forgotten corner of the kingdom.

"There has to be more," she whispered to the night. "There has to be a way."

The distant lights of Allemarea seemed to pulse in response, beckoning with promises of power and knowledge. And somewhere, just at the edge of her awareness, Naimente thought she felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the spring air—as if something ancient and patient had heard her words and was answering with silent anticipation.

The fire waits for you.
