## CHAPTER 30: THE PRINCE'S REVELATION

In the blue-gray light before dawn, when even the most vigilant palace guards grew heavy-lidded, King Aethen Ael'Dae worked in perfect silence. His private study—the only room in the royal chambers Naimente rarely entered—had become his sanctuary and confessional. A single candle illuminated the pages of a leather-bound journal, its spine worn smooth from countless nights like this one.

His artist's hands moved with practiced precision across the paper, charcoal capturing what words could not express and what others could not see. Today's sketch showed Naimente as she had appeared in yesterday's war council—her elegant profile rendered with loving attention to detail, but with disturbing elements no one else had noticed: the almost imperceptible fissures along her jawline that appeared when she grew angry, glowing from within like cooling lava; the unnatural angle of her fingers when she gestured, as though the bones had begun to transform into something inhuman; the crimson gleam that momentarily replaced violet when she sentenced three citizens to death for "water worship."

Aethen captured the composition of light and shadow across her features with painful precision—the chiaroscuro effect revealing more truth than the council's scribes ever recorded. An artist sees what others merely look at. This had been his gift since childhood, and now it had become his burden.

He turned to earlier pages, a visual chronicle of Naimente's transformation. The first sketches showed her as he had seen her when they met—beautiful, determined, her eyes bright with purpose rather than power. In those early drawings, he had captured a genuine tenderness in her expression, the careful way she held herself when treating patients, the gentleness in her hands. Each subsequent page documented subtle changes: her posture becoming more rigid and commanding, her expressions hardening into something imperial, her eyes gradually shifting from violet to crimson.

In the margins, he had written dates and observations in a cipher of his own creation—a musician's notation that appeared decorative to anyone without training in the ancient form. Her words, translated from melody to meaning: "These provinces require purification." "Compassion is inefficient." "Weakness must be burned away."

He closed the journal and pressed his fingertips against its leather binding. The cover was slightly warm, as though the observations contained within generated their own heat.

"When did I become so skilled at seeing, yet so afraid to act?" he whispered to the empty room.

The candle's flame danced in response, casting elongated shadows across his face—a momentary illusion of fire upon his own skin. He did not miss the irony.

* * *

The Audience Chamber gleamed with ostentatious splendor. Since taking the throne, Naimente had replaced Allemarea's traditional blue banners with crimson and gold, commissioned new mosaics depicting stylized flames, and maintained the chamber at an uncomfortable warmth that left courtiers perpetually dabbing perspiration from their brows. Today she held court from a newly fashioned throne—black volcanic stone inlaid with obsidian that caught the light like frozen fire.

Aethen sat in a smaller throne beside her, positioned slightly behind hers—a physical manifestation of his diminished role. His crown, once identical to hers, had been "modified" to incorporate flame motifs that mimicked hers but with less prominence. The symbolism was lost on no one, least of all him.

"Ambassador Velthen, your request for increased water rations for the Eastern Quarter is denied," Naimente stated, her voice carrying the peculiar resonance it had developed in recent months—a harmonic quality that seemed to bypass the ear and reverberate directly in the listener's chest. "The drought conditions are regrettable but not exceptional. The citizens must adapt to the changing climate."

Aethen observed the ambassador's carefully neutral expression. Once, the man would have argued passionately for his district's needs. He had been known for his advocacy, risking Queen Iolara's displeasure many times to secure resources for the poorest citizens. Now, he simply bowed and retreated, eyes downcast. Another voice silenced by Naimente's fire.

"The Eastern Quarter reservoir has fallen to critical levels," Aethen said quietly, measuring each word with the same care he used when mixing pigments for delicate watercolors. "Perhaps a limited increase would prevent unnecessary suffering among the children and elderly?"

Naimente's hand closed over his on the armrest, her skin unnaturally hot. To observers, the gesture appeared affectionate; Aethen felt the warning in her grip, the painful pressure over his knuckles where his fingers had once broken during adolescence—a detail from his past that she had learned and now weaponized with perfect precision.

"My king concerns himself with matters of state better left to those with broader perspective," she said, her smile never reaching her eyes. "The Eastern Quarter's struggles reflect poor resource management, not insufficient allocation." Her fingers tightened incrementally. "Isn't that right, my love?"

"Of course, my queen," he replied, the practiced response flowing automatically while he cataloged the new fissures visible along her wrist when her sleeve fell back. "Your wisdom guides us all."

Her grip relaxed, satisfaction crossing her features. She believed she controlled him completely—a puppet king whose strings she pulled without resistance. It was the one blindness in her increasingly paranoid perception, the single oversight that gave him space to breathe.

She thought him weak because he created beauty rather than destroyed it. She had always thought him weak. His palette of blues and greens seemed insignificant beside her reds and blacks. The oversight might save what remained of his kingdom.

As the court proceedings continued, Aethen studied the courtiers with artist's precision, composing mental sketches of their fear. It manifested differently in each person—the slight tremor in Minister Caval's hands when Naimente looked his way, the fixed smile of Lady Nerithe who once wore blue jewelry daily but now wore only gold, the carefully neutral expression of Commander Telren whose fingers unconsciously formed the sign of the waterfall whenever Naimente looked away.

Only Maiya, Naimente's personal advisor, maintained genuine composure, her dark eyes revealing nothing as she stood at the queen's left hand. Yet Aethen had learned to see what others missed. The way Maiya's fingers tapped silent rhythms against her thigh—patterns too precise to be nervous habit, the same rhythm repeated at key moments. How she sometimes touched the high collar of her gown when Naimente spoke of water restrictions, concealing something worn beneath. The careful distance she maintained from the heated throne, as though uncomfortable with excessive temperature.

Details that formed a picture only he had assembled, studying each component like separate brushstrokes that created a complete image.

When court finally adjourned, Naimente turned to him with the private smile she reserved for him alone—a gesture that still carried echoes of genuine affection beneath the calculation. He saw the momentary softening in her eyes, like watercolor bleeding into parchment, a glimpse of the woman he had fallen in love with.

"You grow quiet these days, my artist king," she said, trailing fingers along his jawline with a touch that was almost tender. "Does the burden of rule weigh on your gentle spirit?"

"I simply prefer to observe," he replied, leaning slightly into her touch despite himself. "You command the court with such natural authority. I would rather not interfere where my contributions add nothing of value."

"Sweet Aethen," she murmured, her voice softening to the tone he remembered from their early days together. "Always so modest about your gifts." For a moment, he glimpsed the woman he had fallen in love with—compassionate, determined, unbound by the corruption that now consumed her. The momentary glimpse was more painful than her cruelty had ever been.

"Will you join me for the ministerial council?" he asked, knowing the answer but performing the expected role.

"I have matters requiring my attention in the eastern wing," she replied, touching the pendant at her throat—a ruby set in black iron that had replaced the simple violet stone she once wore. "Review the agricultural reports. I'll expect your summary this evening."

She departed in a swirl of crimson silk, courtiers parting before her like a sea before fire. As she passed a decorative brazier, its flames leapt higher, responding to her proximity in a way no natural fire should. The courtiers pretended not to notice, having learned that acknowledging such phenomena could be interpreted as accusation.

Maiya remained behind, collecting documents with practiced efficiency. As she passed Aethen, she dropped a sheet of parchment. Their eyes met briefly as he bent to retrieve it—hers dark and intent, carrying a message beyond words.

"An error in the Eastern Quarter census, Your Majesty," she said, her voice perfectly modulated for court etiquette. "Perhaps you could review it personally? The numbers concerning water distribution might interest you."

"Of course," he replied, accepting the document with a nod. "I appreciate your thoroughness, Advisor Maiya."

Between the census columns, nearly invisible unless one knew to look: *Water still flows beneath the fire's notice. Tonight. The third bell. The Blue Vessels await.*

* * *

The memory came unbidden as Aethen navigated the forgotten passages beneath the palace—the recollection of a child's discovery three decades earlier.

He'd been seven, playing hide-and-seek with his cousins during a summer feast. Seeking the perfect hiding place, he had discovered a servant's door behind a tapestry depicting Allemarea's founding. The weaving had shown the great waterfall in threads of silver-blue that seemed to move in the candlelight. The door behind it led to a narrow staircase. Descending with a child's fearless curiosity, he had found himself in ancient corridors predating the current palace.

The walls bore faded murals depicting Allemarea's founding—the great waterfall, the first settlers with their upturned faces expressing wonder, and the blessing of Daecillaea, depicted as a woman formed entirely of flowing water. His small fingers had traced the painted waterfall, feeling unexpected coolness from pigment that should have been room temperature.

Following the sound of trickling water, he had discovered a small chamber where a natural spring emerged from the stone, filling a basin carved with symbols he couldn't read. The water glowed with gentle blue luminescence, creating patterns across the ceiling that seemed to move with purpose rather than randomness.

He had dipped his fingers into the basin, and for a moment, felt completely at peace. When he returned to the feast hours later, no one had missed him—though he had been absent far longer than a game of hide-and-seek should have lasted. The adults merely smiled at his dirty hands and let him take an extra honey cake, assuming he'd been playing in the gardens.

Now, twenty years later, those same passages felt both familiar and changed. Some corridors had collapsed, forcing detours through spaces that smelled of old stone and mineral-rich dampness; others showed signs of recent usage—disturbed dust, fresh scuff marks on ancient stone, even a dropped blue thread caught on a rough corner. Twice he froze at the sound of voices, pressing himself into alcoves until palace guards passed, their torches casting orange light that seemed harsh and intrusive compared to the gentle blue luminescence that grew stronger as he descended.

His artist's memory mapped the twisting route, each turn bringing him deeper beneath the palace, into chambers forgotten by all but a few. The air grew cooler, the omnipresent heat of Naimente's palace giving way to a damp chill that raised gooseflesh on his arms. When he finally reached the small doorway he sought, his candle's flame bent toward it, as though drawn by an unseen current.

The chamber beyond had changed since his childhood discovery. The basin remained, still filled with gently glowing water, but the walls now bore fresher paintings overlaying the ancient ones—symbols matching those he had seen in the oldest books in the royal archives. Offerings surrounded the pool—small blue stones arranged in circular patterns, carefully crafted paper boats with tiny messages inscribed inside, woven wreaths of river reeds interspersed with blue flowers that shouldn't have been able to grow underground. Evidence of recent devotion, despite Naimente's harsh penalties for water worship.

"The Blue Vessels," he whispered, understanding flowering like ink in water. The resistance wasn't merely a political movement—it was a revival of Allemarea's original faith, a return to the blessing that had founded their kingdom before fire began to consume it.

Aethen approached the basin with reverence born of memory and desperate need. His reflection wavered in the luminescent water—a face older and more careworn than he typically acknowledged, with shadows beneath his eyes and lines of worry creasing his brow. A king's face, bearing a kingdom's suffering.

"I don't know if you can hear me," he said softly to the water. "I don't know if you're real in the way Naimente's fire is real. But I've run out of options. My kingdom burns from within, and I've been too weak, too afraid, to stop it."

The water's surface remained still, his reflection unwavering. No divine sign, no miraculous response. Just water and silence.

With a sigh that carried years of helplessness, Aethen dipped his fingers into the basin.

The world dissolved into blue light.

*He floated in limitless azure depths, yet breathed effortlessly. Around him, Allemarea appeared—not as physical buildings but as connections between people, shimmering threads linking heart to heart, community to community, a complex pattern like the finest lacework he'd ever attempted to paint. The connections pulsed with life and memory, creating a web that was Allemarea's true essence beneath stone and policy.*

*The beautiful network was burning. Thread by thread, fire consumed the connections, replacing community with isolation, love with fear. The flames didn't destroy randomly but moved with purpose—targeting the strongest connections first, severing them with precise cruelty. At the center of the conflagration stood Naimente—but not as he knew her.*

*Her human form had become merely a shell, cracked and breaking like pottery in a kiln. Within those cracks burned something ancient and hungry, a presence of overwhelming power and destructive intent. It reached through her, using her hands to sever connections and ignite fears. Using her voice to speak words that burned truth away. Using her position to dismantle everything Allemarea had been.*

*Worst of all, Aethen saw himself beside her—a hollow puppet whose strings fed directly into the fire at her core. Every time he remained silent, the fire grew stronger. Every time he obeyed rather than questioned, more threads burned. His complicity fed the very flames consuming his kingdom.*

*Yet the vision shifted. Beneath the burning network, water still flowed—hidden currents connecting springs and wells, ancient waterways forgotten but not gone. The Blue Vessels moved through these currents, preserving connections the fire hadn't yet reached, maintaining a shadow network of resistance and hope.*

*He saw others too—figures moving toward Allemarea from different directions. One carried knowledge like a blue flame that didn't burn; another measured and calculated in patterns that strengthened rather than severed connections; a third moved with warrior's purpose, protecting what remained with fierce determination. They formed a triangle around the burning center, creating a pattern that contained and opposed the fire's expansion.*

*But something was missing—a fourth position remained empty, a gap in the pattern that made it incomplete. The vision pulled him toward this empty space, showing how it aligned with the heart of the fire itself.*

*A voice spoke, not in words but in the sensation of cool water against fever-hot skin:*

*"The king who sees must choose. The gentle hand may divert the flame. The artist's eye may preserve what fire would erase. But water demands sacrifice to oppose fire. Are you willing?"*

*The weight of the question pressed against him like deep water, testing his resolve. Aethen didn't hesitate: "I am."*

*The vision shifted again. He saw himself standing before Naimente's forces, saw fire consuming him, saw his death becoming both weapon and shield. Saw how his choice could create a momentary weakness in the fire's defenses—not victory, but opportunity for those better equipped to save what remained.*

*"The vessel breaks, but water flows on," the presence expressed. "Remember what you have seen. Paint it with your actions when the moment comes."*

The vision released him. Aethen found himself kneeling beside the basin, tears streaming down his face, mingling with the glowing water where his hands remained submerged. For the first time in months, his mind felt completely clear—Naimente's subtle influence washed away, if only temporarily.

He saw everything now: what she had become, what she planned, what his role must be. The water had shown what fire had hidden.

* * *

"You took considerable risk coming here yourself, Your Majesty."

Maiya's voice emerged from the shadows of a small antechamber adjacent to the shrine. She stepped forward, no longer the perfect court advisor but a resistance leader—her posture straighter, her eyes revealing a sharp intelligence typically concealed at court. She wore a simple blue tunic beneath her advisor's robes, with Daecillaea's symbol embroidered at the collar. Around her neck hung a familiar pendant—a small violet stone identical to the one Naimente had once worn but discarded.

"I recognize that pendant," Aethen said softly.

Maiya's fingers touched it briefly. "It was my sister's—Lyra. Naimente gave it to her before..." Her voice hardened. "Before she failed to save her, before she turned to fire instead of accepting death as part of life's cycle."

"The risk is justified by necessity," Aethen replied, returning to her original statement. "You've served her while working against her. You've seen what she's become."

"I watched my sister die in her care," Maiya said simply. "Lyra was the first sacrifice to her ambition, though certainly not the last. I accepted the position as her advisor to monitor her transformation—every betrayal, every murder, every pact with fire deepened. I've documented it all for the resistance."

"As have I, in my way," Aethen said, producing his journal. The leather binding felt unnaturally cool after his vision, as though the water's influence lingered. "My observations may appear as art, but they reveal patterns even your spies cannot access. Her transformation accelerates. The physical changes become harder to conceal. Soon, she won't bother hiding what she's become."

Maiya accepted the journal, studying the sketches with careful attention. Her fingers traced the precise lines with the reverence of someone who understood the courage required to create them. "Your eye for detail is remarkable," she acknowledged. "These correlate with our observations but provide visual evidence we lacked." She turned to a particular sketch—Naimente standing before a map table, planning the assault on Arnekol, her shadow falling across the city not in human form but as a writhing flame. "You were present for this?"

"She believes me harmless," Aethen replied, unable to keep bitterness from his voice. "A decorative king too weak to oppose her. My presence raises no suspicion, and my artistic scribblings seem merely the hobby of a sheltered mind."

"A blindness we can exploit," Maiya said, returning the journal. "Our network extends throughout Allemarea and now coordinates with the alliance of Tarthenia, Arnekol, and Kor. We need detailed intelligence on her military preparations and, more importantly, on her personal vulnerabilities."

"I can provide both," Aethen confirmed. "Her war plans occupy the eastern wing, where she conducts rituals she believes I know nothing about. She underestimates how well sound travels through the palace's old ventilation system—my childhood explorations mapped every listening point. And I've observed patterns in her transformation—moments when the fire consumes her control, leaving her vulnerable."

He hesitated, then continued with painful honesty, "But we must acknowledge the truth. She doesn't simply command fire magic—she's becoming a vessel for something ancient and terrible. In her more unguarded moments, she speaks of 'glorious transformation' and 'Tarashren's ascendance.' I believe she intends not simply conquest but complete elemental transformation of the region."

"Our information suggests the same," Maiya confirmed grimly. "The Blue Vessels have preserved ancient knowledge of the Furies. What manifests through Naimente is Tarashren attempting to regain dominance lost centuries ago when Allemarea chose Daecillaea's blessing." She touched the basin's edge reverently. "Our resistance isn't merely political—it's the continuation of an elemental conflict predating human settlement."

"Then we face an enemy far beyond mortal opposition," Aethen said quietly.

"Not entirely," Maiya replied. "The alliance forms around three individuals connected to Daecillaea—the Scholar, the Merchant, and the Warrior. Each carries a different aspect of water's nature to counter fire's singular force. And now, perhaps, a fourth aspect emerges." She studied him intently. "The Artist, who sees truth and preserves memory."

Aethen felt a shiver of recognition from his vision. "The fourth position in the pattern," he murmured.

Maiya's eyes widened slightly. "You've seen it too, then. The water speaks clearly to you." She nodded, as though confirming a suspicion. "Few royals maintain such connection to Daecillaea. It's why she fears you more than she admits, why she works so hard to keep you controlled."

Aethen considered this with newfound clarity. "Naimente plans a major offensive against Tarthenia within a fortnight. She's gathered seven battalions of fire-touched soldiers at the northern garrison, with three more preparing at the eastern gate. But her most dangerous weapon isn't military." He lowered his voice further. "She's constructing something beneath the palace—a chamber of volcanic stone where she conducts rituals drawing power directly from the earth itself. I've seen the plans, though I understand little of their purpose."

"This information could save thousands," Maiya said. "Can you provide the exact locations and patrol schedules?"

"I'll need time to document everything properly," Aethen replied. "My movements are watched, but not as closely as others. I can create detailed maps disguised as architectural studies—she knows my interest in the palace's construction and won't question such drawings."

"Time grows short," Maiya warned. "Our sources indicate her transformation nears completion. When Tarashren fully manifests through her, Naimente as we knew her will cease to exist entirely."

The implications settled heavily between them. Despite everything, Aethen still felt the echo of love for the woman he had married—the healer with violet eyes and genuine passion for improving the world. That woman was nearly gone, consumed by fire and ambition.

"I loved her," he said simply. "I still do, in some broken way. I keep hoping some fragment of her remains that can be reached, that the woman who once healed with gentle hands isn't completely burned away."

"I know," Maiya replied, unexpected gentleness in her voice. "That's why you're essential. You love what she was, but you see what she's become. Few maintain that balance. It gives you clarity where others would be blinded by either hatred or devotion."

The distant toll of a bell interrupted them—a warning that the palace guard would soon change shifts, briefly increasing patrols throughout the lower levels.

"We must return separately," Maiya said. "Use the western passage—it avoids the main guard rotation. I'll ensure this information reaches our network and the alliance." She hesitated, then added, "Your Majesty, the vision you experienced... Daecillaea rarely communicates so directly. Whatever you saw—"

"Will remain between me and the water," Aethen finished firmly. "Some knowledge is meant for its recipient alone."

She nodded, understanding. "Until the third bell tomorrow night, then. The Blue Vessels will be ready when you are."

* * *

Naimente waited in their private chambers, her silhouette sharp against the flames of an oversized hearth. She had dismissed the servants, leaving them alone—a circumstance that once would have pleased Aethen but now filled him with wary calculation. He noticed, with an artist's precision, how the fire behind her responded to her presence—flames bending toward her like flowers following the sun, unnatural in their movement.

"You missed the agricultural review," she said without turning. "Minister Kelrath reported your absence with considerable concern."

"I needed time to think," Aethen replied, the partial truth easier to maintain than complete fabrication. "The Eastern Quarter situation troubles me. So many children without adequate water..."

"Always so concerned with minor discomforts," she said, turning to face him. In the firelight, the fissures along her cheekbones were more visible than they had been earlier, glowing ember-red beneath her skin. Her eyes held more crimson than violet now, the color shifting with her emotions like coals brightening when stirred. "You allow yourself to be distracted by individual trees while I tend the entire forest."

"Perhaps the forest needs its trees," he suggested, measuring his words carefully. "A kingdom is its people, after all."

Something dangerous flashed in her expression—a momentary crack in her controlled facade. The fire behind her surged higher, responding to her emotion with a roar that sent sparks cascading onto the stone floor. "A kingdom is order and strength," she replied, her voice carrying that unnatural resonance that made his chest vibrate uncomfortably. "Individual discomfort is irrelevant against greater purpose. The Eastern Quarter's water restrictions serve a greater design you cannot yet comprehend."

She approached him with feline grace, her movements too smooth, too precise for natural human motion. Her hands, when she touched his face, burned with feverish heat.

"You seem different tonight," she observed, studying him with unsettling intensity. "Something in your eyes... a clarity I haven't seen recently." Her head tilted slightly, reminding him of a predator assessing potential prey. "Where have you been, my gentle king?"

Aethen felt momentary panic—could she sense the water's influence? Did Tarashren's power allow her to detect Daecillaea's touch? He forced himself to lean into her caress, to maintain the facade of gentle submission that had become his armor.

"I'm only tired," he said, affecting the slight hesitation that typically accompanied his interactions with her. "The court's demands grow heavier. And I worry for our people."

Her fingers traced his jawline, up to his temple, her touch uncomfortably hot against his skin. Her eyes narrowed slightly—searching, assessing. For a terrible moment, he felt her consciousness pressing against his thoughts, seeking access to his mind as she had increasingly done in recent months.

He lowered his gaze, allowing genuine fear to surface—not of discovery, but of losing himself again to her influence. The fear provided perfect cover for his secrets.

"My gentle king," she murmured, apparently satisfied with what she found. "Always so concerned with others' welfare. It's why I chose you—that compassionate heart balances my necessary strength." She pressed her lips to his forehead in a gesture that mimicked tenderness but felt like branding. "Rest now. Tomorrow brings significant developments requiring your symbolic presence."

"Symbolic?" he echoed, unable to keep a hint of bitterness from his voice.

Her smile combined indulgence and dismissal. "The people respond to tradition. You represent Allemarea's past; I am its future. Together, we bridge what was and what must be." She turned away, returning to the fire that seemed to bend toward her like a loyal pet. "Sleep well, my king. Dream of the greater Allemarea we build together."

When she focused her attention back on the flames, Aethen retreated to his chambers, locking the door behind him—a minor act of separation she allowed because she believed it meaningless. In the privacy of his room, he removed his journal from its hiding place and opened to a fresh page.

With charcoal and purpose, he began to draw—not Naimente this time, but the palace layout, noting guard positions, secret passages, and the location of the mysterious chamber she had constructed. On separate pages, he detailed patrol schedules and security patterns, disguising the information within architectural studies that would appear as mere artistic exercises to casual observers.

In the margins, he wrote in his musical cipher:
*The vessel breaks, but water flows on.*

Every line he drew felt like a eulogy and a promise. His sacrifice would not be wasted. His death would serve a purpose greater than his life had managed. The vision had shown him the role he must play—not hero, not savior, but catalyst. The moment of choice was approaching faster than the resistance realized.

Naimente planned something catastrophic, something that would transform not just Allemarea but the entire region. He had seen enough in her war chamber to recognize the pattern, even if he didn't understand the magical principles behind it. The mysterious chamber, the strategic positioning of fire-touched soldiers, the timing aligned with astronomical calculations she had ordered from the royal astronomer—all pointed to a ritual of unprecedented scale.

Aethen completed his drawings with meticulous attention to detail, then concealed them within his journal's false binding. Tomorrow he would find a way to deliver them to Maiya. Tomorrow he would continue playing the role of decorative king while gathering final intelligence for the resistance.

And soon—very soon—he would make his final move, using the only advantage Naimente had given him: her underestimation of what an artist's eye could see and what a gentle heart could sacrifice.

As he prepared for bed, Aethen gazed out his window toward the city below. Despite Naimente's restrictions, despite the fear permeating the kingdom, lights still glimmered in windows. People still lived, loved, hoped. Children still played in secret with toy boats in washing basins. Elders still whispered old stories of Daecillaea's blessing.

Water still flowed beneath the fire's notice.

"I was never the king you deserved," he whispered to the city. "But perhaps I can be the king you need, just once, when it matters most."

The distant sound of the great waterfall—reduced now to a trickle under Naimente's rule—carried faintly through his window. Its diminished voice seemed to whisper back: *Remember.*

In the darkness of his room, Aethen made his final decision. The artist would become a different kind of tool—not one that created beauty, but one that would sacrifice itself to preserve what beauty remained. He would be the brush that painted his final masterpiece in the medium of his own life.

And when the time came, Naimente would discover that water could be just as relentless as fire, and that seeing was the first step toward acting.
