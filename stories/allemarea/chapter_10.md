## CHAPTER 10: THE WARRIOR'S ASSESSMENT

The ceremonial sword felt wrong in Rin's hand—too ornate, its balance compromised by decorative gems embedded in the hilt. She adjusted her grip, compensating for the weapon's flaws as she surveyed the Allemarean training grounds. Around her, courtiers in impractical finery gathered on viewing platforms, sipping wine from delicate glasses while they awaited the martial demonstrations.

"A beautiful weapon, Princess Tarthan," remarked Commander Velenas, the Allemarean Master of Arms. "Crafted specially for diplomatic exhibitions."

Rin nodded curtly, resisting the urge to point out that a sword's beauty meant nothing if it couldn't cut properly. In Tarthenia, weapons were judged by their effectiveness, not their appearance.

"We're honored by your willingness to participate in today's demonstration," he continued, gesturing toward a raised platform where the royal family would soon be seated. "Such exchanges strengthen the bonds between our kingdoms."

She returned the ceremonial blade to its scabbard, her callused fingers brushing against the hilt of her own sword—plain, well-worn leather wrapped around steel that had seen actual combat. The symbol etched into the pommel—a stylized rendering of water and flame in balance—briefly caught the sunlight. To most observers, it would appear merely decorative, but Rin knew it represented one of the oldest traditions of her people, dating back to before Tarthenia's founding.

"In Tarthenia," she said, her voice low and measured, "we believe bonds are forged through honest challenge, not performance."

Commander Velenas's smile tightened. "Of course. Different traditions, all valuable in their own way."

Rin's gaze swept over the training grounds. The sand was too fine, spread too evenly—maintained for appearance rather than functionality. Real battlefields were uneven, treacherous. Real combat was messy, brutal, and decidedly unglamorous. But Allemarea's nobility preferred beautiful illusions to uncomfortable truths—a weakness evident in everything from their ornamental weapons to their self-indulgent politics.

The herald's voice rang out, announcing the royal family. Rin straightened, assuming the formal stance of a Tarthenian representative—back rigid, shoulders squared, chin level. She watched as King Rinthal and Queen Iolara took their places, followed by Prince Aethen and his new bride, Naimente.

The prince's eyes were fixed on his wife with unmistakable devotion. Queen Iolara's expression remained carefully neutral, though Rin noted the tension in her jaw. Most interesting was Naimente herself, whose unusual violet eyes surveyed the gathering with serene confidence that belied her recent elevation from commoner to royalty.

There was something about those eyes that triggered Rin's battlefield instincts—the same heightened awareness that had saved her life during the Mountain Pass ambush three years ago. Something not immediately threatening but fundamentally wrong, like the subtle shift in air pressure before a storm.

As Naimente's gaze briefly met hers, Rin's hand moved instinctively to her sword hilt, fingers touching the ancient symbol. To her surprise, the metal felt unusually warm beneath her fingertips, though the day was mild.

"The demonstrations will begin with an exhibition of Allemarean cavalry maneuvers," Commander Velenas announced, "followed by traditional sword forms demonstrated by our royal guards, and concluding with an exchange of martial disciplines between our Master of Arms and Crown Princess Rinelle Tarthan of Tarthenia."

Rin inclined her head at the mention of her name, maintaining the dignity expected of her position while inwardly calculating how soon she could reasonably depart this charade.

* * *

The cavalry demonstration proved precisely as Rin had expected—elaborate formations executed with technical precision but minimal tactical value. The horses, magnificent animals bred for appearance rather than endurance, performed intricate patterns that would be suicidal in actual combat.

"Impressive display," commented a voice beside her.

Rin turned to find the merchant princess from Arnekol—Eilene Anaed'Rui—watching the proceedings with an expression that suggested she shared Rin's assessment, though for different reasons.

"Impressive waste of training time," Rin replied bluntly. "They've spent months perfecting movements that would get them killed in seconds against a competent enemy."

The corner of Eilene's mouth quirked upward. "I was calculating the cost of maintaining horses bred for show rather than function. The resource allocation is... inefficient."

Rin reassessed the merchant princess, recognizing a practical mind beneath the diplomatic exterior. "You see patterns."

"As do you, though perhaps different ones." Eilene's gaze shifted toward the royal platform. "Have you formed an impression of our newest royal?"

Rin followed her glance to where Naimente sat beside Prince Aethen, accepting a goblet from his hand. "Nothing concrete."

"Yet something concerns you." It wasn't a question.

Rin's hand moved unconsciously to her sword hilt—a habit when thinking through strategic problems. "In battle, sometimes you sense an ambush before you see it. The instinct develops through experience." She paused. "I sense something here, but cannot name it yet."

Eilene nodded slightly. "Merchants develop similar instincts about investments that appear too favorable."

Their exchange was interrupted as the royal guard took the field for sword demonstrations. Rin watched critically, cataloging their strengths and weaknesses. The guards moved with rehearsed precision through formal patterns, their techniques fundamentally sound but lacking the adaptability that real combat required.

"They train for form, not function," she noted quietly. "Note how they always return to center position between movements—a fatal habit in actual combat."

"You've seen considerable action," Eilene observed.

"Enough." Rin's mind flashed to the Southern Border campaign, the metallic smell of blood mixed with dust, the weight of command as she'd ordered the flanking maneuver that saved her forces but cost eight lives. "Tarthenia's borders require constant vigilance."

The royal guard finished their demonstration to polite applause. Commander Velenas approached, bowing formally to Rin.

"Princess Tarthan, if you would honor us with a demonstration of Tarthenian martial discipline."

Rin nodded once, stepping forward onto the training ground. She removed her formal outer tunic, revealing the simple, functional attire worn by Tarthenian warriors—leather reinforced at key points, designed for movement rather than display. The murmurs from the courtiers suggested they found her practical clothing almost scandalously plain.

She drew her own sword rather than the ceremonial blade. The weapon made a clean, crisp sound as it left its scabbard—the voice of well-maintained steel. For a moment, she stood motionless, centering herself.

Under her breath, she recited her lineage, a Tarthenian ritual before any significant action: "Daughter of Darath, son of Morvaine, daughter of Eralith, son of Tarthus..." Back through sixteen generations to the founder of her line. The ritual connected her to her ancestors and their strength.

Then she began.

The Tarthenian battle form known as the Wind Reaper started slowly—deliberate movements gathering momentum like a building storm. Unlike the Allemarean patterns with their showy flourishes, these were battlefield techniques designed for maximum effectiveness with minimal energy expenditure. Each strike flowed into the next, leaving no openings, creating a continuous sequence that could be sustained through extended combat.

As the form progressed, Rin increased her speed, her movements becoming a blur of controlled violence. The courtiers fell silent, their idle chatter replaced by a tense awareness that they were witnessing something fundamentally different from the performances that had preceded it—not an exhibition, but a glimpse of true martial capacity.

When the final movement concluded—a devastating combination that would disable three opponents in rapid succession—Rin stood at ready stance, breathing evenly despite the intensity of the demonstration. The silence extended for several heartbeats before scattered applause began, uncertain at first, then growing as the audience processed what they had witnessed.

Commander Velenas stepped forward, genuine respect in his eyes. "Tarthenian disciplines are indeed formidable, Princess. Would you honor us by demonstrating the applications against multiple opponents?"

Rin assessed the commander's request—an unusual deviation from the planned ceremony, but one that offered the opportunity to gather more information about Allemarean fighting capabilities.

"If your men are willing," she agreed.

Four royal guards stepped forward, drawing training swords. They surrounded Rin in standard formation, exchanging glances that revealed both professional curiosity and a hint of skepticism. She noted their positioning, the slight stiffness in their formal stance, the unconscious telegraph of their intended movements.

"Begin when ready," she said calmly.

The guards attacked in sequence rather than simultaneously—their first mistake. Rin moved like water around the first strike, redirecting the guard's momentum while delivering a controlled hit to his armored shoulder. He staggered back as she pivoted to meet the second attacker, dropping beneath his swing and tapping her sword against his knee guard.

The remaining two attacked together, showing better coordination. Rin gave ground strategically, creating an angle that forced them to interfere with each other. When one hesitated to avoid colliding with his companion, she exploited the momentary opening with a swift combination that left both men off-balance.

Within thirty seconds, all four guards had been neutralized without a single blow that would cause serious injury. Rin returned to ready stance, then formally saluted her opponents.

"Well fought," she acknowledged, though her assessment was more generous than accurate.

From the royal platform, Prince Aethen applauded enthusiastically. "Remarkable! I've never seen such fluidity of movement."

Beside him, Naimente studied Rin with intensified interest, her unusual violet eyes reflecting something more calculated than mere appreciation of skill. "Tarthenia's martial traditions clearly deserve their reputation," she said, her voice carrying clearly across the training ground. "Such strength offers valuable protection for your kingdom."

There was something in her tone—a subtle emphasis on 'protection' and 'your kingdom'—that prickled Rin's instincts again. The comment seemed innocuous on its surface, yet carried undercurrents she couldn't quite identify.

"Strength without purpose is mere brutality," Rin replied, quoting a Tarthenian maxim. "We train to defend, not to dominate."

Naimente smiled, the expression not quite reaching her eyes. "A noble distinction."

As their gazes locked, Rin noticed something disturbing—a momentary flicker in Naimente's violet eyes, a flash of crimson like embers catching light. It was gone almost instantly, but Rin's combat-honed senses registered the anomaly, filing it away with other warning signs she'd observed since arriving in Allemarea.

* * *

Later, as the formal demonstrations concluded and the gathering transitioned to the inevitable Allemarean refreshments, Rin extracted herself from stilted conversations about her "extraordinary display" and "impressive physical abilities." The courtiers' fascination with martial skill as entertainment rather than necessary survival discipline grated on her nerves.

She found a relatively quiet corner of the garden where she could observe without constant interaction. From a small leather pouch at her belt, she withdrew a partially carved wooden figure and a small knife. Her fingers moved automatically, shaping the wood with practiced precision as her mind processed the day's observations.

Allemarea's military capacity was concerning—not for its strength but for its weakness. Their forces trained for ceremony rather than combat, their weapons prioritized appearance over function, and their tactics seemed designed for controlled environments rather than the chaos of actual battle. If threatened by a determined enemy, they would crumble quickly despite their numerical advantage.

More concerning was the evident decay in their command structure. Commander Velenas himself was competent enough, but the officers beneath him seemed selected for family connections rather than capability. During the cavalry demonstration, Rin had noted at least three moments where formation changes were delayed by confused signals—mistakes that would prove fatal against real opposition.

"A curious practice for a warrior princess."

Rin looked up to find Naevyn Daecilrith, the Korian diplomat, regarding her carving with scholarly interest. Unlike most who interrupted her private moments, he kept a respectful distance, his posture non-intrusive.

"Scholar-diplomats are equally curious," she replied, continuing her work. "Yet here we both are."

Naevyn smiled slightly, acknowledging the point. "I was impressed by your demonstration earlier. It revealed much about Tarthenian martial philosophy."

"As intended." The wood took shape beneath her blade—the figure of a mountain falcon taking flight, details emerging with each careful cut. "Demonstrations serve multiple purposes."

"Indeed." He adjusted his spectacles. "I couldn't help noticing your assessment of Allemarea's forces. Professional interest, I assure you."

Rin glanced up, studying him more carefully. Korian diplomats were known for their scholarly facades that often concealed sharp strategic minds. "Scholars study many subjects."

"Including regional security implications of military readiness—or its absence." He gestured toward the wooden figure taking shape in her hands. "The falcon—a hunter with keen vision and decisive action. A Tarthenian symbol?"

"My mother's totem," Rin replied simply. "She carried its image into her final battle."

Understanding flickered in Naevyn's eyes. "My condolences for your loss, Princess Tarthan."

"She died as she lived—protecting our borders." Rin's knife made a precise cut, defining the falcon's wing. "Her example guides my duty."

She paused, considering whether to share more with this scholarly diplomat who seemed more perceptive than most she encountered at court. Against her usual reserve, she added, "In Tarthenia, we maintain the warrior-poet tradition. Every soldier learns not only combat, but creation. The blade that takes life must also honor it."

Naevyn's expression registered genuine interest. "A profound balance. Kor's traditions emphasize knowledge and diplomacy, but perhaps overlook the wisdom in such integration of seemingly opposite disciplines."

"We are more than our weapons," Rin said, her hands continuing their careful work on the carving. "Though many here see only the martial aspect of Tarthenia."

"A powerful legacy." Naevyn glanced toward where Naimente was holding court among a group of nobles, Prince Aethen at her side. "Have you had much opportunity to converse with our newest royal?"

Rin followed his gaze, that same uneasy sensation returning as she observed Naimente. "Briefly. Her rise has been... remarkable."

"Indeed. A village healer to queen in a matter of months." Naevyn's tone remained academic, but Rin detected the careful probe beneath his words. "Her healing abilities are said to be extraordinary."

"So the stories claim." Rin's fingers tightened slightly on her carving knife. "Tarthenia's healers understand that sometimes wounds cannot be closed by will alone."

"A perspective grounded in practical experience," Naevyn acknowledged. "Different from Allemarea's current fascination with miraculous solutions."

Their conversation was interrupted as a palace attendant approached, bowing formally to Rin. "Princess Tarthan, Queen Iolara requests the honor of your company in the west solar."

Rin concealed her surprise, nodding acknowledgment. She returned the carving and knife to her pouch, rising with fluid grace. "Another time, Scholar Daecilrith."

"I look forward to it, Princess." He bowed slightly as she departed.

* * *

Queen Iolara's private solar offered a stark contrast to the bustle of the court gathering. The chamber was appointed with refined elegance rather than ostentatious display—evidence of the queen's more sophisticated tastes compared to the general Allemarean excess.

"Princess Tarthan," Iolara greeted her, dismissing her attendants with a subtle gesture. "Thank you for indulging my request during what must be a tedious day of ceremonies."

"Your Majesty." Rin bowed with appropriate formality. "The invitation was unexpected."

"Yet you accepted readily enough." Iolara studied her with shrewd assessment. "I've always appreciated Tarthenian directness. Perhaps we might speak plainly together?"

Rin measured her response carefully. Queen Iolara's reputation for political acumen was well-established, and this private meeting clearly had purpose beyond social courtesy.

"Plainly is how Tarthenians prefer to speak, Your Majesty."

Iolara smiled thinly. "Then let us be plain. Your demonstration today revealed more than martial skill. It showed a commander's assessment of our forces."

"I observed as any visitor might," Rin replied neutrally.

"And saw what any experienced military leader would—that Allemarea's defenses have grown complacent." The queen moved to a window overlooking the palace grounds. "A concerning vulnerability in uncertain times."

Rin remained silent, recognizing the dangerous currents beneath this conversation. Queen Iolara was either seeking information or attempting to establish some form of alliance—neither purpose aligned with Rin's diplomatic mandate to observe and report without entanglement.

"Tarthenia and Allemarea have maintained peaceful relations for generations," Iolara continued. "Different as our kingdoms are, regional stability benefits both."

"A truth my father acknowledges," Rin confirmed cautiously.

"And a stability potentially threatened by... unpredictable elements." Iolara turned from the window, her expression carefully controlled. "You watched my son's wife today with a warrior's eyes, Princess Tarthan. What did you see?"

The directness of the question caught Rin by surprise, though she maintained her composed exterior. "I saw a woman recently elevated to significant influence," she answered carefully.

"Nothing more?" Iolara pressed. "No... instinct that might concern a warrior accustomed to identifying threats?"

Rin's hand moved unconsciously to her sword hilt. The queen was probing dangerous territory—suggesting concerns about her own daughter-in-law that could be construed as treasonous if reported. That she would take such a risk with a foreign dignitary suggested either desperation or calculation deeper than Rin could immediately discern.

"Instincts are useful on the battlefield," Rin replied, "but diplomatic contexts require more substantial evidence before action."

Iolara studied her with sharp intelligence. "A diplomatic answer worthy of Kor rather than Tarthenia." She moved to a cabinet, removing a small wooden box inlaid with silver. "Are you familiar with the traditional exchange gifts between our kingdoms, Princess?"

"The historical accounts mention them, though the practice has not continued in recent generations."

"Indeed." Iolara opened the box, revealing a medallion of dark metal inscribed with ancient symbols. "This was presented to Allemarea by Tarthenia's King Morvaine—your grandfather, I believe—during the Border Accord negotiations."

Rin recognized the medallion instantly—a Tarthenian truth-stone, traditionally exchanged during important treaties to symbolize commitment to honest dealings. The symbols etched into its surface were older than Tarthenia itself, dating back to the pre-imperial era. They matched those on her sword pommel—ancient marks representing elemental balance.

"A gesture of good faith during complex negotiations," she acknowledged.

"More than that, according to certain traditions." Iolara closed the box, her expression unreadable. "Old stories claim such medallions could reveal falsehood in their presence—that the metal would grow warm against deceit."

"Stories often embellish historical objects with mystical properties," Rin replied neutrally, though she knew the queen's words held more truth than Allemarea likely realized. The medallions were indeed crafted with ancient methods said to respond to elemental imbalance—a tradition preserved by Tarthenian weaponsmiths through generations.

"Perhaps." Iolara returned the box to its cabinet. "Yet I find myself increasingly appreciative of old traditions in recent days. They often contain wisdom we've forgotten in our... modern enlightenment."

The conversation had moved into territory fraught with unspoken implications. Queen Iolara was clearly concerned about Naimente and seeking potential allies, but her approach suggested uncertainty rather than clear evidence of threat.

"Traditions endure because they serve purpose," Rin conceded. "In Tarthenia, we maintain many ancient practices that outsiders might consider superstitious."

"Such as?"

"Before battle, our warriors recite their lineage back sixteen generations. Some say it merely focuses the mind, others believe it calls upon ancestral strength." Rin watched the queen's reaction carefully. "Either explanation serves the practical purpose of centering the warrior's resolve."

"Sixteen generations," Iolara mused. "A connection to one's origins and purpose. A valuable perspective when new influences arise."

The implicit message was becoming clearer—the queen feared Naimente's influence and sought to remind Rin of traditional allegiances and concerns. Whether this stemmed from mere political calculation or genuine alarm remained unclear.

"Tarthenia values its historical connections with Allemarea," Rin stated formally. "My presence here reflects our commitment to maintaining those relationships through changing times."

Iolara nodded, apparently satisfied with this diplomatic affirmation. "I'm gratified to hear it. These are... interesting times for our kingdom. Change can bring opportunity, but also risks for all regional powers."

"My father remains attentive to regional developments," Rin assured her, maintaining the careful balance of diplomatic courtesy without committing to specific support.

"As a wise ruler should be." Iolara moved toward the door, signaling the conversation's conclusion. "I've appreciated your candor, Princess Tarthan. Perhaps we might speak again before your departure."

"I would be honored, Your Majesty."

As Rin departed the solar, she reflected on the layered meanings beneath their exchange. Queen Iolara was preparing contingencies—reaching out to potential allies as Naimente's influence grew. The reference to the truth-stone medallion suggested concerns beyond mere political rivalry, possibly touching on the old beliefs that most modern Allemareans dismissed as superstition.

Most concerning was the implication that Queen Iolara, with all her political acumen and access to royal records, felt sufficiently threatened to risk approaching a foreign dignitary with such veiled warnings.

* * *

Night had fallen by the time Rin returned to her quarters in the diplomatic wing. The evening's formal banquet had been predictably tedious—excessive courses of over-spiced food, interminable speeches praising the glory of Allemarea, and stilted conversations with nobles more interested in her exotic "warrior culture" than in meaningful exchange.

Her guard, Kelthar, rose from his post as she entered the outer chamber. A veteran of twenty years' service who had served her mother before her, his weathered face reflected both vigilance and familiarity.

"The perimeter is secure, Princess," he reported. "Though I've noted increased patrols in the diplomatic wing since this afternoon."

"Following our demonstration, no doubt," Rin replied, beginning the process of removing her formal court attire. "What do you make of their forces?"

Kelthar's expression conveyed volumes. "They have numbers and equipment. What they lack is..."

"Everything else," Rin finished. "Tactical discipline, practical training, adaptable command."

"Precisely." He helped her remove her ceremonial armor, his movements efficient from long practice. "Their formations would shatter against our second-tier units, let alone the Royal Guard. It's... concerning."

"More concerning than their obvious weakness is how blind they are to it," Rin moved behind a screen to change into more comfortable attire. "They genuinely believe their demonstrations represent combat readiness."

"Dangerous delusion in uncertain times," Kelthar noted. "Especially with their northern borders so lightly patrolled."

Rin emerged in simple Tarthenian clothing—sturdy trousers and a loose tunic that allowed free movement. "You noticed that too?"

"During our journey here. The checkpoint garrisons were undermanned, and those present were poorly disciplined." Kelthar handed her a sealed message tube that had arrived during her absence. "From King Darath, delivered by our fastest rider."

Rin broke the seal, unrolling the parchment with careful fingers. Her father's strong, angular script filled the page—a detailed report on border movements near their shared frontier with Allemarea, followed by specific instructions regarding her diplomatic mission.

"Increased activity along the Forest Road," she summarized for Kelthar. "Merchant caravans diverted without explanation. Timber shipments delayed."

"Consistent with preparations for increased military capacity," Kelthar observed. "Building supplies, equipment transport..."

"Or simple administrative incompetence," Rin countered, continuing to read. "My father requests detailed assessment of Allemarea's current court dynamics and military readiness."

"A timely request."

Rin moved to the writing desk, removing a sheet of parchment and preparing ink. After a moment's consideration, she took out her zithern—a traditional Tarthenian string instrument—and placed it beside her. Some messages were best composed with a clear mind, and the ancient patterns helped focus her thoughts.

Her fingers moved across the strings, playing a simple melody from her childhood. The rhythm and tone helped organize her observations, transforming scattered impressions into coherent assessment.

After several minutes, she set aside the instrument and began meticulously documenting her observations. Her training in military assessment allowed her to detail Allemarea's defensive vulnerabilities with precise efficiency—the overemphasis on ceremonial function, the clear gaps in patrol schedules, the command structure compromised by nepotism rather than merit.

When she reached the section addressing court dynamics, she paused, considering how to articulate her unformed concerns about Naimente. The rational portion of her assessment was straightforward—a commoner's unprecedented rise to royal status, the evident tension between Queen Iolara and her new daughter-in-law, the shifting allegiances among court factions.

More difficult to convey was the visceral unease she felt in Naimente's presence—the same battlefield instinct that had warned her of ambush in the Mountain Pass. There was something fundamentally wrong about the woman's violet eyes, about the way flames seemed to burn more brightly in her presence, about the subtle shifts in Prince Aethen's previously gentle demeanor.

After consideration, she wrote:

*New Queen Naimente presents particular concern. Her influence over Prince Aethen exceeds normal marital bounds. Queen Iolara clearly perceives threat, has made veiled overture suggesting alliance. Most concerning is pattern consistent with old accounts of elemental imbalance—subtle environmental responses to her presence, unusual eye coloration with momentary crimson flashes, accelerated ascension to power.*

*While court appears stable on surface, underlying tensions suggest potential for rapid deterioration. Queen Iolara's reference to Grandfather's truth-stone medallion implies awareness of older threats beyond political rivalry. The symbol on the medallion matches our ancestral markings for elemental balance.*

*Recommend increased border vigilance and preparation for potential regional instability. Also request access to Ancestral Archives regarding historical accounts of elemental vessels and countermeasures developed during pre-imperial conflicts.*

Rin paused, knowing the last request would raise significant questions at court. The Ancestral Archives contained Tarthenia's oldest records, including accounts of the elemental conflicts that had shaped the region before the establishment of current kingdoms. Access was traditionally limited to the royal family and high commanders during times of crisis.

That she would request such access based on diplomatic observations would signal to her father the seriousness of her concerns. Yet she could not justify stronger language based solely on instinct, however reliable that instinct had proven in battle.

She completed the report with formal recommendations for Tarthenia's diplomatic and military posture toward Allemarea—cautious engagement while preparing for potential deterioration in relations. After sealing the document, she summoned Kelthar to arrange for its dispatch at first light via their most trusted courier.

With that duty completed, Rin moved to the chamber's small balcony overlooking Allemarea's central district. The city glittered with lanterns and torchlight, the great waterfall visible in the distance, illuminated by the full moon. Beautiful and seemingly secure in its ancient prosperity.

Yet her warrior's eye noted details others might miss—the reduced flow of the waterfall compared to historical descriptions, the patterns of guard patrols that prioritized palace security over citizen protection, the subtle signs of strain in the kingdom's foundations.

From her belt pouch, she withdrew the partially carved falcon figure and her small knife. As her hands resumed their careful work, giving form to the wood with practiced precision, her mind processed the complex diplomatic and strategic questions raised by the day's observations.

She had come to Allemarea as Tarthenia's representative, expecting tedious ceremony and routine alliance maintenance. Instead, she found herself assessing potential threats that extended beyond conventional military concerns—threats that resonated with the oldest traditions of her kingdom, predating even the founding of Tarthenia itself.

The falcon took shape beneath her blade—wings extended in flight, eyes fixed on distant prey, posture embodying decisive action after patient observation. Her mother had carried such a carving into her final battle, a talisman representing Tarthenian virtues of clear sight and purposeful strength.

"I see clearly, Mother," she murmured to the night air. "Though I do not yet understand all that I see."

The wooden figure would remain unfinished for now—a reminder that her assessment of Allemarea and its new queen was likewise incomplete. But Rin had learned through bitter experience that waiting for complete certainty often meant waiting too long.

Sometimes a warrior must act on instinct, trusting the warning signs that precede visible danger. Her message to her father would ensure Tarthenia prepared for uncertainty while she continued to observe and assess the true nature of the threat emerging in Allemarea's deceptively glittering court.
