## CHAPTER 5: A LIFE DEBT

Blood soaked the forest floor, black against the fallen leaves. The hunting party had established a makeshift camp where Prince Aethen lay motionless on a hastily prepared bed of cloaks. Captain Trell knelt beside him, pressing cloth against the wound that refused to stop bleeding. The prince's skin had taken on an alarming pallor, his breathing shallow and irregular.

"He weakens," Trell murmured to Lord Brennan, his weathered hands now stained crimson. "The wound is deep—I can see bone through the flesh." Resignation shadowed his face; he had seen enough battlefield injuries to recognize death's approach.

The sound of approaching hoofbeats drew the attention of the gathered men. Two riders emerged from the forest path—Valyn leading, followed by a young woman whose composed demeanor seemed at odds with the urgency of the situation.

Naimente dismounted before her horse had fully stopped, her unusual violet eyes immediately finding the injured prince. She assessed the scene with a healer's precision: the amount of blood lost, the labored breathing, the positioning of the wound. She moved forward with quiet authority, village clothing stark against the nobles' finery.

"Stand aside," she instructed, voice steady as she knelt beside Aethen.

Trell hesitated, protective instinct warring with desperation. Something in her eyes—a certainty beyond her years—finally compelled him to move aside. "We've done what we could, healer. The wound..."

"I can see the wound," Naimente replied, gently removing the blood-soaked cloth. The injury gaped hideously—a jagged tear where the boar's tusk had ripped through flesh and muscle, exposing glimpses of rib beneath. Several of the watching nobles turned away, unable to stomach the sight.

"He should be dead already," Lord Brennan observed grimly. "I've seen men perish from less severe injuries."

"Yet he lives," Naimente replied without looking up. "That speaks to his strength." Her fingers probed gently around the wound, her expression revealing nothing of the horror that such an injury would normally evoke. Instead, her face showed only focus—a healer evaluating a problem to be solved.

"I need clean water, fresh cloths, and privacy," she stated, already reaching for her satchel. "And fire—build it here, beside him."

"Fire?" questioned one of the nobles, an older man with an elaborate silver brooch. "Surely the heat will—"

"Do as she says," Trell ordered, already gathering kindling. Despite his misgivings, the prince's life hung by a thread; this was no time for debate.

As the men moved to follow her instructions, Naimente leaned closer to Aethen, studying his face. Even in unconsciousness, there was a refinement to his features that seemed at odds with the violence of his injury. His pain showed in the tight lines around his eyes, in the shallow rise and fall of his chest. A strand of light brown hair lay across his forehead—the ama'lhe, she recalled from old stories, that marked Allemarean royalty.

"You will not die today, Prince," she whispered, too low for others to hear. "Not when I finally have the power to prevent it."

The wrapped mark on her palm tingled with warmth, as if responding to her determination. She flexed her hand, feeling the strange heat spread up her arm like branching rivers of fire beneath her skin.

Within minutes, a small fire crackled nearby. The hunting party had withdrawn to a respectful distance at her insistence, leaving only Captain Trell standing guard a few paces away, his hand resting instinctively on his sword hilt. Naimente positioned herself between the fire and Aethen's still form, allowing her shadow to fall across him.

"Captain," she called, "I need you to hold him steady. What I do may cause him to move suddenly, which could worsen the injury."

Trell nodded grimly and positioned himself at Aethen's shoulders, placing strong hands firmly but gently on the prince's upper arms. Years of battlefield experience had taught him to assist healers without question during critical moments, whatever his personal doubts.

"The rest of you," Naimente addressed the watching nobles, "must stay back regardless of what you see or hear. Do you understand?"

Uncertain murmurs of agreement answered her. Satisfied, she turned her attention fully to Aethen. She unwrapped the cloth from her left palm, revealing the perfect flame-shaped mark that had appeared after her pact with Tarashren. It pulsed faintly in the daylight, like a second heart beating within her hand.

Naimente closed her eyes, centering herself as Aedil had taught her years ago. But where her mentor had called upon ancient healing traditions—the slow, patient ways of herb and poultice—Naimente now reached for the fire within. The mark on her palm flared brighter, its edges taking on a molten glow.

She placed her marked hand directly over the worst part of the wound, her other hand resting on Aethen's forehead. The prince's skin burned with fever, yet felt cold compared to the furnace heat building in her palms.

Taking a deep breath, Naimente began to whisper—words that seemed to echo with a deeper resonance than her voice alone should carry. Unlike the healing chants Aedil had taught her, these words came instinctively, rising from somewhere beyond conscious thought, as if another voice spoke through her.

"From ash to ember, from death to life," she intoned. "Let what burns without consume what kills within."

The firepit beside them flared suddenly higher, flames leaping upward as if responding to her words. Several watchers stepped back in alarm, making warding gestures. Shadows danced wildly across the forest clearing, stretching and contracting in patterns that seemed almost deliberate.

Beneath Naimente's palm, the wound began to change. Blood that had flowed freely now slowed, as if hesitant to escape. Torn flesh trembled, edges seeking their original position. A sound emerged—not quite a sizzle, not quite a sigh—as damaged tissue began to knit together. The scent of burnt copper filled the air, mingling with the forest's earthy dampness.

Sweat beaded on Naimente's forehead. Her breathing deepened, became labored. The veins in her arms stood out prominently, tracing paths that seemed to glow faintly beneath her skin, like embers embedded in her flesh. Most striking were her eyes—when she opened them briefly to check her progress, the violet had been nearly consumed by crimson, as if fire burned behind them.

"Gods above," whispered one of the nobles, making the sign of the waterfall—Daecillaea's blessing. "What manner of healing is this?"

Trell said nothing, but his grip on Aethen's shoulders tightened. His expression remained stoic, yet his eyes revealed deep disquiet at what he was witnessing. In thirty years of service, he had seen battlefield healers work remarkable recoveries, but nothing like this—nothing that made fire respond as if alive, nothing that made human flesh mend before his eyes like wax reforming.

Aethen's body jerked suddenly, causing Trell to press down more firmly. A low moan escaped the prince's lips—the first sound he had made since losing consciousness. His eyelids fluttered but didn't open.

"Hold him," Naimente commanded, her voice strained and overlaid with a subtle harmonic that hadn't been there before. "We're at the threshold."

The mark on her palm now blazed brightly enough to cast its own light, visible even in daylight. Heat radiated from it, creating a shimmer in the air like that above summer stones. Where her hand touched Aethen's wound, an impossible transformation continued—muscle rejoining muscle, severed vessels reestablishing their connections, skin stretching to close the gap that had exposed his vitals to the air.

Naimente's face contorted with effort. Whatever power she channeled extracted a price from her own body. Perspiration soaked her clothing, and a thin trail of blood escaped her nostril, tracing a crimson path down to her lip. The veins at her temples pulsed visibly.

"Enough," Trell said, alarmed by her deteriorating condition. "You're harming yourself."

"Almost... finished," she gasped, ignoring him. The words seemed to cost her tremendous effort, as if she were speaking while carrying a great weight.

The fire beside them suddenly collapsed, flames disappearing as if suddenly starved of fuel, leaving only smoking embers. In the same instant, Naimente pressed her palm more firmly against Aethen's now-closed wound and spoke a final word—a sound that seemed to ripple through the air with physical force, making the surrounding leaves shiver.

Aethen's eyes flew open, his back arching as he drew a desperate, whooping breath. His hands clutched reflexively at air, then at his side where the mortal wound had been. His gaze darted wildly around before focusing on the face above his—Naimente, pale with exhaustion but triumphant.

For a moment, they simply stared at each other. Naimente saw confusion giving way to wonder in his hazel eyes. Aethen saw something equally astonishing—a young woman with extraordinary violet eyes ringed with fading crimson, who had somehow pulled him back from darkness.

"You were dying," she whispered, swaying slightly. "And now you're not."

Then her strength failed. She would have collapsed had Trell not released Aethen to catch her. He lowered her gently to sit on the ground beside the prince, his instinctive distrust temporarily overcome by the need to prevent further injury.

"Water," she managed to say, gesturing weakly toward her satchel. "The blue vial."

Valyn, who had been watching in stunned silence, quickly retrieved it. Naimente drank deeply, color gradually returning to her face. The liquid wasn't merely water—it carried the faint scent of herbs and something metallic. Meanwhile, Aethen pushed himself up to sitting position—a movement that should have been impossible given his injury moments before.

"Careful, Your Highness," Trell cautioned, reaching to support him.

"I feel no pain," Aethen said wonderingly, his hand moving to his side. Where the gaping wound had been, only a pink line remained—a scar that looked months old rather than minutes. "How is this possible?"

The nobles had gathered closer, their earlier trepidation replaced by amazement. Several made religious gestures. Lord Brennan knelt beside the prince, examining the healed injury with disbelief.

"A miracle," he pronounced. "I've never seen its like."

"Not a miracle," Naimente corrected, her voice stronger now but still carrying a hint of exhaustion. "Simply a healing method beyond what you're familiar with." She quickly rewrapped her left palm, concealing the mark that had now returned to a normal appearance. She had revealed too much already; the nobles need not see everything.

Aethen's gaze never left her face. There was wonder in his expression, yes, but also something more—the keen assessment of an artist noting details others would miss. He had seen the patterns beneath her skin during the healing, had noticed how the fire responded to her words, had felt the unnatural heat flowing into him when she'd touched his wound.

"You saved my life," he said simply. Then, with surprising strength for someone so recently at death's door, he took her hand. "I am in your debt, healer."

"Naimente," she offered. "My name is Naimente Kamame."

"Naimente," he repeated, the name warm on his tongue. Something passed between them in that moment—a connection beyond rescuer and rescued. The air between them seemed to shimmer slightly, visible perhaps only to them.

Aethen surprised everyone, perhaps even himself, by bringing her hand to his lips in a courtly gesture rarely bestowed upon commoners. "The royal house of Allemarea owes you a debt that cannot be repaid. Ask what you will, and if it is in my power to grant, it shall be yours."

His sincerity was evident, unmistakable. This was no mere formal gratitude—there was wonder in his eyes, and something more. The artist in him recognized something extraordinary about her that went beyond her healing abilities. He saw the determination in the set of her jaw, the intelligence in her eyes, the quiet dignity in her bearing despite her humble clothing.

As their hands met, Naimente felt a curious sensation—the mark on her palm grew warmer, not painfully but noticeably, as if responding to his touch. A tendril of heat seemed to pass between them, and for an instant, she thought she saw a flicker of red in the depths of his hazel eyes—gone so quickly she might have imagined it.

"I ask nothing, Your Highness," she replied, though her mind raced with possibilities. "Healing is its own reward."

"Nonsense," declared Lord Brennan, having recovered his composure. "Such service must be acknowledged. The Queen herself will wish to reward you."

At the mention of his mother, a flicker of something—apprehension?—crossed Aethen's face. He glanced at Trell, who gave an almost imperceptible nod.

"Indeed," Aethen said, turning back to Naimente. "But first, tell me of your work. Where did you learn such healing? I've never seen physicians at court accomplish anything remotely similar."

His interest seemed genuine, not merely polite conversation. There was an intensity to his gaze that suggested he saw more than he revealed—an artist's perception that caught details others missed.

Before Naimente could respond, however, Trell intervened.

"Forgive me, Your Highness, but perhaps such discussions should wait. You've both endured much. Rest would be wise before the journey back to the palace."

Aethen nodded reluctantly. "Of course. You're right as always, Captain." He looked back at Naimente. "But I would hear more, when strength returns. Your methods could help many in Allemarea."

"I would be honored to share what I know," Naimente replied, surprised to find herself meaning it. There was something in the prince's manner—a genuine curiosity, an appreciation for knowledge—that she hadn't expected from Allemarean royalty. According to village rumors, the royal family cared little for common people's suffering. Yet Aethen seemed different.

The camp was quickly reorganized. Despite Aethen's miraculous recovery, Trell insisted he rest before attempting the return journey. A tent was prepared for him, while another was hastily erected for Naimente—an unexpected courtesy that reflected her newly elevated status.

* * *

As she settled onto the surprisingly comfortable bedroll provided for her, Naimente examined her palm in the privacy of the tent. The flame mark had returned to its normal appearance, but the skin around it remained unnaturally warm. She could feel the power inside her, banked but not extinguished, like coals after a great fire.

For the first time since accepting Tarashren's gift, she questioned what she had embraced. The healing had succeeded beyond her expectations—but at what cost? She had felt something change during those moments of greatest power, as if something else had reached through her, using her hands as its instruments. The blood from her nose, the exhaustion that had nearly claimed consciousness—these were not normal, even for the most taxing healing work.

She remembered Lyra, the child whose death had driven her to seek greater power. Would Lyra have lived, had Naimente possessed this ability then? Almost certainly. The memory hardened her resolve. Whatever price this power demanded, it was worth paying if it meant saving lives that would otherwise be lost.

Yet the benefits were undeniable. She had saved a life deemed unsavable. She had demonstrated skill that would open doors previously closed to her. She had caught the attention of a prince—not just his gratitude, but his interest. In her village, she healed individual ailments but could do nothing about the systemic neglect and poverty that caused so much suffering. Perhaps now, with royal connections, she could effect greater change.

The end justified the means. This was her path forward, her opportunity to make a real difference.

She clenched her fist, feeling the lingering heat pulse in response. Whatever she had tapped into today, she would learn to control it better, to use it more effectively. She would master this power rather than being mastered by it.

Outside, she could hear the nobles discussing her in hushed but carrying voices—speculation about her background, debate over appropriate rewards, wonder at the "miracle" they had witnessed. Their tone had transformed from the initial skepticism to something approaching reverence.

It was intoxicating.

And yet, a tiny voice whispered caution in the back of her mind—Aedil's voice, reminding her that all power comes with a price, that fire without water burns unchecked. Naimente pushed the thought aside. She would control this fire. She would direct it toward healing. She would use it to change Allemarea for the better.

The heat in her veins pulsed in response, almost like quiet laughter.

* * *

Aethen lay on his bedroll, staring up at the tent canvas. Though Trell had insisted he rest, sleep eluded him. His mind could not stop replaying what had happened—the sensation of life flowing back into his body, the extraordinary violet eyes watching him return from darkness, the lingering warmth where her hand had touched his side.

He pressed his own hand to the newly formed scar. By all rights, he should be dead. The wound had been mortal—he had seen enough hunting accidents to know when injuries passed beyond recovery. Yet here he was, breathing easily, feeling stronger with each passing minute.

His artist's eye had captured details others missed. During the healing, patterns like flame had seemed to move beneath Naimente's skin. Her eyes had contained impossible colors—violet overlaid with crimson, shifting like dawn light on water. And there had been a scent unlike anything he'd encountered before—not medicinal herbs as one might expect from a healer, but something more elemental, like earth after lightning strike.

Most of all, he remembered the moment their eyes met as consciousness returned—a connection that felt significant beyond explanation. He had always been sensitive to beauty in unlikely places, and there had been a terrible beauty in that moment—pain and power and triumph mingled together.

She was unlike anyone he had ever met at court. There was no artifice in her manner, no careful calculation in her gaze. Instead, he sensed purpose, determination, and intelligence unconstrained by court protocols. She had saved his life without hesitation, pushing herself to the edge of collapse in the process.

He reached for his satchel, pulling out the sketchbook that never left his side. With quick, sure strokes, he began to capture Naimente as he had seen her during the healing—head thrown back, eyes flaring with inner light, veins glowing beneath her skin. The drawing took shape rapidly, his hands remembering what his conscious mind could barely comprehend.

His thoughts were interrupted by Trell entering the tent.

"How do you feel, Your Highness?" the captain asked, his concern evident.

"Better than I have any right to," Aethen replied honestly, closing his sketchbook but not before Trell glimpsed its contents. "It's extraordinary, Trell. I should be dead or dying, yet I feel I could ride back to the palace this moment."

Trell's expression remained troubled. "The healing was... unusual, Your Highness."

"Remarkable," Aethen corrected. "Miraculous."

"Perhaps." Trell hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "But perhaps not entirely... natural."

Aethen raised an eyebrow. "You sound like my mother. Next you'll suggest it was dark magic and have the poor woman investigated by the temple authorities."

"I would never presume—"

"I know, old friend." Aethen smiled, reaching to clasp Trell's arm. "You worry for my welfare, as always. But consider—if her methods were truly malevolent, would she have exhausted herself saving me? Would she have asked for nothing in return?"

Trell nodded slowly. "A fair point, Your Highness. Still, there was something about the healing that gave me pause. The way the fire responded, the light beneath her skin..." He trailed off, unsure how to articulate his concerns without sounding superstitious.

"There was something about it that gave us all pause," Aethen acknowledged. "But whatever method she used, I owe her my life. I intend to learn more about her work. Such healing ability shouldn't remain hidden in a forest village—imagine the good it could do in Allemarea."

"As you say, Your Highness." Trell's tone was respectful but noncommittal. "The men have prepared food, if you feel strong enough to eat."

"Thank you. I'll join them shortly."

After Trell departed, Aethen rose carefully, testing his renewed body. The site of the wound tugged slightly but caused no real pain. He dressed slowly, mind still dwelling on the healer.

Naimente Kamame. A name he would not forget. A face that had imprinted itself on his memory with the clarity of his most vivid sketches. A presence that had altered something fundamental within him—and not just through the physical healing.

He wanted to know everything about her methods, her training, her life in that small village. He wanted to introduce her to the court physicians, to see her abilities recognized and honored. He wanted—

Aethen paused, surprised by the direction of his thoughts. What exactly did he want? The question lingered as he stepped from the tent into the evening air.

Across the camp, Naimente emerged from her tent at the same moment. Their eyes met over the heads of the gathered nobles, and Aethen felt again that strange connection—a pull that seemed both natural and somehow orchestrated, as if invisible threads were being woven between them by unseen hands.

A life debt, indeed. But perhaps something more was beginning—something neither of them could fully comprehend.

* * *

The journey back to the village the following morning was marked by a new dynamic. Naimente, once merely a village healer, now rode beside Prince Aethen at his insistence. The nobles, who might have ignored her existence days earlier, now watched her with expressions ranging from respect to lingering wariness.

"Tell me of your training," Aethen requested as they rode side by side. "Where did you learn such extraordinary techniques?"

Naimente considered her response carefully. "I was apprenticed to our village's previous healer, Aedil. She taught me the foundations—herbs, bandaging, setting bones. The traditional ways."

"But what you did goes far beyond such methods," Aethen observed, his artist's eye still seeing the echo of fire beneath her skin.

"Yes," Naimente acknowledged. "In recent times, I've... discovered new approaches. Ways to channel healing more directly."

She tensed slightly, expecting skepticism or accusations of witchcraft. Instead, Aethen's expression showed only fascination.

"Discovered how? Through experimentation? Ancient texts?" His gentle voice held genuine curiosity rather than accusation.

His genuine interest caught her off guard. This was not how nobles typically responded to village healers claiming unusual abilities.

"Both," she replied, finding herself wanting to share more than prudence might dictate. "And through... intuition. Some healing knowledge seems to exist beyond conscious learning."

"Like art," Aethen said, surprising her. "Technical skill can be taught, but true creation requires connecting to something deeper. Something beyond explanation."

Naimente studied him with new appreciation. "Exactly. Though most wouldn't make that comparison."

"Most haven't had the opportunity to experience both," he said with a smile that transformed his refined features, revealing an unexpected warmth. "I've spent years trying to capture the quality of light on water—yet never succeeded as fully as I'd like. Your healing has that same quality of reaching beyond the visible world to affect what truly matters."

The insight was unexpected from an Allemarean prince she'd assumed would be as shallow and self-absorbed as rumors painted the royal court. They continued discussing healing methods, Aethen asking perceptive questions that revealed genuine understanding of the challenges she faced in her work.

As they approached Merrow's Hollow, Naimente sensed a decision point approaching. The prince would continue to the palace, and their paths would diverge—unless she took action to ensure otherwise.

"The techniques I used to heal you," she said carefully, "could benefit many others. But our village lacks resources to develop them properly."

"That must change," Aethen replied immediately. "Such healing should be available to all of Allemarea, not just those fortunate enough to find themselves near your village when disaster strikes."

"Your Royal Physicians might disagree," she pointed out. "Established healers rarely welcome new methods, especially from... unconventional sources."

Aethen's expression grew determined, a flash of steel beneath his gentle exterior. "Then they must be persuaded." He seemed to make a decision. "You must come to the palace, Naimente. Present your methods to the court. With my support, you'll have the opportunity to demonstrate what you can do."

The invitation—the opportunity—was precisely what she had hoped for, yet it came more easily than expected. She wondered briefly if Tarashren's influence extended beyond healing, if the connection she felt with Aethen had been somehow engineered by the power she had embraced.

But looking into his eyes, she saw only genuine appreciation and interest—a recognition of her abilities that she had sought for years.

"I would be honored, Your Highness," she replied, the decision made. "Though I have responsibilities here—"

"Of course. Make whatever arrangements necessary. Send word when you're ready, and I'll ensure an escort brings you safely to Allemarea." His smile held promise and something more—a connection that transcended their brief acquaintance.

As they entered the village, Naimente saw the gathered faces of people she had known all her life—now looking at her with a mixture of pride and unease. They had heard of her feat, of course; news traveled quickly in small communities. They recognized that something had changed, that their healer had been noticed by powers beyond their small world.

"Word of your remarkable healing has preceded us," Aethen noted. "Your people seem proud."

"Most of them," Naimente agreed, noticing Aedil standing apart from the others, her expression troubled. "Not all embrace change easily."

The royal party paused only briefly in the village. Aethen made a point of publicly thanking Naimente again, formally inviting her to visit the palace "at her earliest convenience." He presented her with a royal token—a small medallion bearing the Ael'Dae crest—marking her as a recipient of royal favor.

When the time came for parting, Aethen dismounted despite Trell's obvious disapproval of the unnecessary delay. He approached Naimente with the same genuine warmth he had shown throughout their journey.

"I won't forget what you've done," he said quietly. "Nor will I forget our conversations. I look forward to continuing them in Allemarea."

"As do I, Your Highness," she replied.

He hesitated, then added, "Something happened during that healing—something beyond the physical repair of flesh. I felt it. I believe you did too."

Naimente nodded slowly, uncertain how to respond. She had not expected such perception from him.

"I don't fully understand it," he continued, "but I know it matters. I've learned to trust such instincts." He smiled. "Until we meet again, Healer Naimente."

As the royal party departed, Naimente stood watching until they disappeared from view. The flame mark on her palm tingled warmly, like a promise of things to come. The path that had opened before her exceeded even her ambitious hopes—a direct connection to the royal family, an invitation to demonstrate her abilities at court, the possibility of gaining resources and influence she had never dreamed possible.

Such opportunity came with risk, of course. The royal court was notorious for its intrigues and dangers. She would be an outsider, viewed with suspicion by established powers. Yet the potential rewards far outweighed such concerns. With royal support, she could transform healing practices throughout Allemarea. She could gain the recognition her gifts deserved. She could, perhaps, even influence policy to better address the needs of villages like her own.

And there was Aethen himself—unexpectedly perceptive, genuinely appreciative of her abilities, somehow attuned to the deeper currents of what had happened during the healing. A potential ally, certainly. Perhaps even more.

Naimente closed her hand around the royal medallion, feeling its weight—the weight of opportunity, of destiny opened before her. The lingering warmth in her veins no longer troubled her. It felt instead like confirmation, like power waiting to be fully claimed.

Behind her, she heard Aedil's familiar step approaching.

"So," her mentor said quietly, "you've caught the eye of a prince."

Naimente turned. "I saved his life. Using methods you fear."

"Methods that changed you," Aedil corrected, gesturing subtly toward Naimente's eyes. "The crimson tint remains, even now. It's becoming permanent."

Naimente involuntarily touched the corner of her eye, momentarily unsettled. "A small price for the power to save lives deemed unsavable."

"Is that all you saved him for? Or do you see a path to something more?"

The directness of the question surprised Naimente. "I saved him because I could. Because it was right." Her chin lifted slightly, defensively.

"And the invitation to court? The royal favor? The medallion you clutch like a lifeline? Are these merely incidental?"

"They're opportunities," Naimente replied firmly. "Opportunities to do more good than I ever could here. To change healing practices that have remained stagnant for generations. To help people on a scale I could never achieve in Merrow's Hollow."

Aedil studied her former apprentice, sorrow evident in her lined face. "I believe you believe that. I even believe it may be part of your motivation. But I also see ambition burning in you like never before—and something else, something that wasn't there when you were simply my apprentice."

The mark on Naimente's palm flared with sudden heat, as if responding to Aedil's accusation. Naimente clenched her fist, suppressing the reaction.

"I've grown," Naimente said simply. "And yes, I'm ambitious. Should I apologize for wanting my abilities recognized? For desiring to make a real difference?"

"No." Aedil shook her head slowly. "But remember this, Naimente: power, once tasted, creates hunger for more. Be certain you control your ambition, rather than allowing it to control you."

"Is that what you fear? That I'll be corrupted by the royal court?"

"I fear you may already be changing in ways you don't recognize." Aedil reached out, briefly touching Naimente's cheek in a rare gesture of affection. "Just promise me one thing—when you're at court, surrounded by new influences, remember why you became a healer in the first place. Remember Lyra."

The mention of the child she couldn't save—Maiya's sister—struck Naimente like a physical blow. For a moment, the heat in her veins seemed to flare painfully.

"I could never forget," she said quietly. "Everything I do is because of Lyra. Because of all the others I couldn't save with traditional methods. This power, whatever its source, lets me prevent deaths that would otherwise be inevitable. How could that be wrong?"

Aedil's expression softened with compassion. "Intent matters, child. But so does source. So does method. Just... be careful. Watch for signs that the power demands more than you intended to give."

They stood in silence for a moment, teacher and former student, the weight of years shared and paths now diverging between them.

"I should prepare," Naimente finally said. "There's much to arrange before I journey to Allemarea."

"Yes," Aedil agreed sadly. "I believe there is."

As Naimente walked away, the royal medallion warm in her palm alongside the hidden mark of flame, she felt herself standing at a threshold. Behind lay her life as a village healer—important work, but limited in scope and recognition. Ahead lay possibility—power, influence, the chance to transform healing throughout Allemarea.

The lingering heat in her veins no longer troubled her. It felt instead like certainty, like destiny, like the fire of ambition given physical form. And if there was a voice that whispered caution deep within her mind, it was easily drowned out by the promise of what awaited in Allemarea.

She had saved a prince's life. Now she would use that accomplishment to build something greater than Aedil could possibly imagine. Greater, perhaps, than anyone could imagine.

Pausing at her door, she looked back toward the forest path where Aethen had disappeared. Their connection had felt real—genuine interest and appreciation rather than mere gratitude. He had seen her, truly seen her, in a way few ever had.

The memory of his hazel eyes—and that fleeting flash of red she'd glimpsed within them—lingered in her mind. A connection had been forged between them, something that transcended healer and patient. Something that would draw them together again.

The power within her pulsed in agreement, warm and seductive, whispering of all that was to come.
