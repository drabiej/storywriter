## CHAPTER 6: THE INVITATION TO COURT

Two weeks passed after Prince Aethen's departure, each day stretching with unusual tedium for Naimente. She tended to villagers with colds and minor injuries, ground herbs for winter remedies, and replaced the thatch on her cottage roof. All the while, the flame mark on her palm pulsed with latent heat, sometimes flaring painfully when her mind wandered toward Allemarea—as if impatient with her mundane existence.

Each evening she found herself standing at her doorway, staring toward the distant lights of Allemarea barely visible on clear nights. Had the prince forgotten her already, distracted by court pleasures? The royal medallion he'd given her grew warm whenever she touched it, almost like a promise—or a lure.

"You're burning the feverfew," Aedil noted one afternoon, her voice cutting through Naimente's distraction.

Naimente startled, quickly removing the small pot from the fire. The precious herbs had indeed blackened, their healing properties now compromised. She frowned at the wasted medicine—feverfew was difficult to gather and essential for treating the painful headaches that plagued miners in the neighboring village.

"That's the third batch this week," Aedil observed, sorting dried leaves with practiced precision. "Your hands heal miraculously now, yet they destroy what they once tended with such care."

"I'm simply tired," Naimente replied, though they both recognized the lie. She wasn't tired—she was restless, filled with an energy that seemed to simmer just beneath her skin.

"Then rest. But consider why fire leaps higher in your presence now." Aedil gestured toward the hearth, where flames had inexplicably intensified despite no additional fuel. "The elements respond to what grows within us."

Naimente glanced at the hearth, momentarily disquieted by the dancing flames that seemed almost to reach toward her. She quickly looked away.

"I've been experimenting with new methods," she said defensively. "Progress requires change."

"Indeed," Aedil agreed, her weathered face revealing nothing of her thoughts. "But one should know what fuels such change. Fire can purify or consume, depending on what masters it."

Instead of arguing, Naimente merely nodded and returned to salvaging what herbs she could. Yet as she worked, she found herself evaluating her surroundings with increasingly critical eyes—the cramped cottage with its smoke-stained ceiling, the worn tools that had once seemed sufficient, the limited supplies that forced constant compromise in treatment decisions. Had she truly been content with such limitations before? Or had she simply never imagined alternatives?

* * *

The royal procession arrived at dawn three days later, startling Merrow's Hollow with unexpected splendor. Six mounted guards in blue and silver livery escorted an ornate carriage bearing the Ael'Dae crest. Children abandoned morning chores to chase after the procession, while adults emerged from cottages with expressions ranging from curiosity to suspicion.

Naimente had been collecting dew-moistened spiderwebs—excellent for stemming blood flow when properly prepared—when the commotion reached her ears. She straightened, heart quickening, and turned toward the village center. The mark on her palm flared with sudden heat, as if responding to the proximity of Aethen.

The carriage had stopped before the village well, its polished wood and silver fittings incongruous among the humble surroundings. As Naimente approached, the door opened, and Prince Aethen emerged. He wore traveling clothes finer than any festival garment in the village, yet somehow carried himself without arrogance—a quiet confidence tempered with genuine interest in his surroundings.

He stood straighter than during their first meeting, all trace of injury vanished. Only someone with Naimente's healing knowledge would know where to look for the scar beneath his fitted doublet. His hazel eyes scanned the gathered villagers until they found Naimente, and his face brightened with recognition that seemed too genuine for mere political calculation.

"Healer Naimente," he called, stepping forward with surprising informality. "I've returned as promised."

Conscious of watching eyes, Naimente curtsied properly. "Your Highness honors our village again."

"The honor remains mine," Aethen replied, approaching until they stood merely an arm's length apart. Lowering his voice, he added, "I've thought of little else since returning to court. Your methods could transform healing throughout Allemarea."

Before she could answer, Elder Korvinn stepped forward, attempting the formal bow his arthritic knees barely permitted. "Welcome, Your Highness. Merrow's Hollow is honored by your presence. We've prepared refreshments, modest though they may be."

Aethen smiled graciously, momentarily setting aside his conversation with Naimente to address the village elder. "Your hospitality is appreciated. I hope to learn more about Healer Naimente's village during my brief stay."

Korvinn's chest puffed with importance. "Of course! We're a humble community, but with a proud history of service to Allemarea. My own grandfather once provided timber for the royal shipyards..."

As the elder launched into familiar village stories, Aethen maintained a polite expression. Naimente observed him carefully, noticing how his artist's eye kept cataloging details—the pattern of light through the trees, the weathered texture of the well stones, the contrast between villagers' sun-darkened skin and his own court pallor. He was recording everything, she realized, building an internal gallery of impressions.

The gathering moved toward the village hall—a modest building that served as meeting place and celebration space. Women hurried ahead to arrange what food they could offer a royal visitor, while men positioned themselves importantly near the prince, each eager to be noticed.

Amid this flurry, Naimente felt Aedil's presence beside her.

"He returns for you, not for our hospitality," the older healer observed quietly.

"He values healing knowledge," Naimente replied, watching Aethen graciously accept a cup of cider from Widow Lenna, who blushed like a girl despite her seventy years.

"He values you," Aedil corrected. "There's a difference. And his eyes see more than most—for good or ill."

Before Naimente could respond, a commotion from the village outskirts drew attention. Telman, one of the shepherds, was carrying his young daughter, her arm bent at an unnatural angle. His face was rigid with the effort of containing his panic.

"Healer!" he called. "Syrna fell from the high rock. Her arm—"

Naimente moved immediately, previous thoughts forgotten. The girl, no more than seven, was pale with shock and pain, whimpering softly against her father's chest.

"Bring her to my cottage," Naimente instructed. "I'll need better light."

As she turned to lead the way, she found Prince Aethen watching her intently, the village's hospitality momentarily forgotten. Without hesitation, he stepped away from the elders.

"May I observe?" he asked, his voice expressing genuine interest rather than idle curiosity.

Naimente nodded, surprised by his forthrightness. "Of course, Your Highness."

Inside her cottage, Naimente directed Telman to place Syrna on the treatment pallet. The child had stopped crying, her eyes wide with fear as she looked from her father to the unexpected royal visitor and back to Naimente.

"It hurts," she whispered.

"I know," Naimente said gently, kneeling beside her. "I'm going to make it better."

She examined the arm carefully, confirming what she had suspected—a clean break of both forearm bones. Traditionally, this would require careful setting, splinting, and weeks of healing, during which the child's arm would remain weak and painful. Telman, a widower who depended on his daughter's help with smaller tasks while he managed their flock, would struggle without her assistance.

In the past, Naimente would have had no choice but to follow the traditional approach. Now, she felt the heat building in her palm, eager to be unleashed. The power no longer waited to be called—it pressed against her awareness like a hound straining at its leash.

Naimente glanced at Aethen, who stood quietly observing, his artist's eyes missing nothing. She felt a strange desire to impress him, to show what she was capable of. The thought brought a moment's disquiet—was she healing the child for the child's sake, or to demonstrate her power?

The mark on her palm flared painfully, dispelling her hesitation. This was a simple choice: weeks of suffering versus immediate relief. What did her motivations matter compared to the outcome?

"Telman, I'm going to try a new method," she said, voice steady with newfound certainty. "It will heal Syrna more quickly than the traditional way."

The shepherd nodded desperately. "Anything, Healer. I trust you."

Naimente positioned herself beside the pallet and placed one hand on Syrna's forehead while unwrapping her left palm. The flame mark gleamed in the cottage's dim light, its pattern seeming to shift subtly as if alive. She felt Aethen move closer, his perceptive gaze missing nothing.

"This will feel warm," she told the child. "Like sitting close to the hearth on a cold night. Try to stay still."

She closed her eyes, centering herself before reaching for the fire within. Unlike before, she didn't need to call the power—it surged forward eagerly, heat flowing up her arm and throughout her body with an intensity that was both exhilarating and frightening. It came more readily than ever, as if gaining strength with each use.

"From ash to ember, from pain to strength," she murmured, placing her marked palm gently on Syrna's broken arm. The words emerged unbidden, resonating with harmonics that hadn't been there during her early healing attempts.

The child gasped—not in pain but in wonder—as warmth flowed into her injury. Unlike with Aethen's near-mortal wound, this healing required less power, yet Naimente found it harder to control the flow. The fire wanted more than this simple break demanded.

The room warmed noticeably. Small flames in the hearth, which had been barely glowing embers, suddenly flared higher, dancing with unusual vigor. Telman stepped back in superstitious alarm, but Aethen moved closer, his eyes intense with fascination.

Naimente felt bones knitting beneath her touch, but also something more—a subtle connection forming between herself and the child, a thread of influence that hadn't occurred during previous healings. For a brief, disturbing moment, she felt she could sense Syrna's thoughts, her fears, her trust in the healer's abilities. The sensation was intoxicating.

Then it passed, leaving Naimente momentarily disoriented. She opened her eyes, knowing they would show the crimson tint that Aedil had warned about. She kept her gaze on Syrna's arm as the healing completed, not yet ready to meet Aethen's observant gaze.

A single drop of blood escaped her nostril, which she quickly wiped away before anyone noticed. That hadn't happened before—a small price for the power coursing through her, surely, but a reminder that each healing altered her in subtle ways.

"There," she said, releasing the girl's arm. "Try moving it."

Syrna flexed her arm carefully, then more confidently. Her small face brightened with amazement. "It doesn't hurt anymore!"

Telman stepped forward, reaching tentatively to touch his daughter's arm. "How is this possible? It would take weeks to mend such a break."

"Healer Naimente has exceptional gifts," Aethen said quietly. His voice carried no fear or judgment—only genuine appreciation. "Gifts that could benefit many in Allemarea who suffer needlessly."

Naimente finally looked up, meeting his gaze directly. There was no superstitious dread in his expression, no calculation—only wonder and that same inexplicable connection she had felt during his own healing. Yet beneath his admiration, she sensed a deeper perception—as if his artist's eye caught details others would miss. Had he noticed the blood, the momentary disorientation, the way the flames had responded to her power?

"Take Syrna home to rest," Naimente instructed Telman, regaining her composure. "The bone is healed, but her body needs to adjust to the rapid mending. She should avoid climbing for at least three days."

After they departed, Naimente and Aethen remained in the suddenly quiet cottage. Naimente wrapped her palm again, though she knew he had seen the mark clearly this time.

"That's the second remarkable healing I've witnessed," Aethen said, breaking the silence. "First my own life, now this child's arm—restored in moments instead of months."

"It's why I became a healer," Naimente replied, closing her herb pots with deliberate movements to hide a slight tremor in her hands—an aftereffect of the power flowing through her. "To mend what's broken."

"Yet you heal one child in this village, while hundreds suffer in Allemarea without access to such methods." Aethen's voice held no accusation, merely gentle observation. "I've seen the wards in our hospitals—children with broken bodies lying in rows, receiving treatments far less effective than what you just demonstrated. Many die from injuries you could likely heal."

The words struck a chord Naimente had been feeling herself—a growing awareness of her own limitations in this setting. She loved her village, but each day brought difficult decisions about which patients received her time, which herbs to conserve, which treatments were possible with limited resources.

"I've reconsidered your invitation," she said slowly. "Though I have concerns."

Aethen nodded, moving to sit on the wooden stool beside her work table. The prince of Allemarea in a village healer's cottage should have seemed absurd, yet he appeared perfectly at ease, his eyes constantly recording details—the arrangement of herbs hanging from rafters, the worn smoothness of her work surfaces, the precise organization of her small supply of medicines.

"Tell me your concerns," he said. "Perhaps I can address them."

"The royal physicians may not welcome new methods," Naimente began, organizing her thoughts. "Court politics may interfere with healing work. And my village needs me—there's no other trained healer except Aedil, who grows too frail for more difficult cases."

"Valid concerns," Aethen acknowledged. "The court physicians are indeed traditional in their approaches, though as prince, I can ensure you the opportunity to demonstrate your abilities. Their resistance will fade when they see results like Syrna's healing." He gestured toward where the child had been. "As for politics..." He smiled slightly. "I can offer guidance there, though I admit it's a complicated realm."

He glanced around the cottage again, his gaze lingering on a small drawing Naimente had made of local healing plants—crude compared to court artists' work, but accurate in the details that mattered for identification.

"You have an eye for essentials," he observed, surprising her with the insight. "That will serve you well at court, where appearances often distract from substance."

Before she could respond to this unexpected perception, he continued, "Regarding your village, I propose a solution. Come to Allemarea initially as my guest, to assess whether your abilities can find proper appreciation there. If you choose to stay longer, I'll arrange for a royal physician to visit Merrow's Hollow regularly until another healer can be properly trained. Your village won't be abandoned."

The offer was unexpected and thoughtful—not dismissing her concerns but addressing them practically. Naimente studied him, searching for signs of deception or manipulation, but found only sincerity.

"Why does this matter so much to you?" she asked directly. "I saved your life, yes, but surely royal gratitude could be expressed through gifts or a pension. Why such effort to bring a village healer to court?"

Aethen seemed to appreciate her directness. "Several reasons," he replied after a moment's consideration. "First, genuine appreciation for your abilities and recognition of how they could help my people. Second..." he hesitated, choosing his words carefully, "there was something about our connection during the healing—something significant that I don't fully understand but feel compelled to explore further."

His candor surprised her. Most nobles would have hidden behind formal gratitude or vague promises.

"And third," he continued, his gaze momentarily drawn to a small sketch hanging beside her bed—a child's drawing, Lyra's last gift before she died, "I believe Allemarea needs more than traditional approaches. Our kingdom has grown comfortable, perhaps complacent. New perspectives—particularly from those who understand common people's needs—could bring valuable change."

The mark on her palm warmed at his words, as if in agreement. The sensation was no longer merely heat but something more complex—a rightness, a sense of destiny unfolding as it should. This was her path forward; she could feel it with increasing certainty.

Before Naimente could respond, the cottage door opened, revealing Aedil. The older healer paused at the threshold, taking in the scene—the prince seated comfortably at a village healer's work table, the lingering warmth in the air, the unwrapped mark on Naimente's palm that she hurriedly covered again.

"Forgive the interruption," Aedil said, her tone carefully neutral. "Elder Korvinn sent me to inform His Highness that refreshments await in the village hall."

"Thank you," Aethen replied, standing with natural grace. "Please tell Elder Korvinn I'll join momentarily." After Aedil withdrew, he turned back to Naimente. "Consider my offer carefully. I'll remain in the village until tomorrow morning, when I must return to the palace."

His eyes lingered on hers for a moment longer than necessary, and Naimente felt that strange connection again—a recognition that transcended their brief acquaintance. Then he was gone, leaving behind a scent of citrus and sandalwood that seemed impossibly refined in her simple cottage.

Naimente stood motionless after his departure, possibilities expanding before her like paths through an unfamiliar forest. The mark on her palm throbbed warmly, as if offering its own opinion on which path to choose.

* * *

Merrow's Hollow staged its best approximation of a royal reception that evening, with villagers contributing what food they could spare for the unexpected honor. Musicians played traditional tunes on hand-carved instruments, while children performed a simple folk dance they had hastily practiced that afternoon.

Naimente observed from the periphery as Aethen engaged graciously with each villager who approached him. Unlike the aloof nobility she had heard described in stories, he listened attentively to elder Korvinn's lengthy histories, admired Widow Lenna's intricate weaving, and showed genuine interest in the shepherds' descriptions of local pastureland.

"He's either remarkably skilled at pretending interest, or genuinely curious about common people's lives," Aedil commented, appearing beside Naimente.

"I believe it's genuine," Naimente replied, watching as Aethen knelt to examine a crude wooden toy a small boy had proudly presented. The prince turned the object carefully in his hands, appreciating its simple craftsmanship with the same attention he might give a court artifact.

"Perhaps," Aedil conceded. "Though genuine curiosity doesn't prevent genuine harm. Even well-intentioned nobles view village lives as interesting curiosities rather than realities equal to their own."

"You're determined to see darkness in this opportunity," Naimente said, irritation flaring unexpectedly. The hearth fire across the room jumped higher for a moment, though no one else seemed to notice the correlation.

"I look for balance," Aedil corrected calmly. "As all healers should. Fire without water burns unchecked. Ambition without compassion consumes its vessel."

Before Naimente could respond, Aethen looked up, catching her gaze across the crowded room. Something passed between them—an acknowledgment, a question, a connection that transcended their brief acquaintance. He nodded slightly, as if confirming a shared understanding, before returning his attention to the child before him.

Later, when the celebration had wound down and most villagers had returned home, Naimente walked alone through Merrow's Hollow. The familiar paths she had known her entire life suddenly appeared different—not just through the lens of imminent departure, but through eyes increasingly attuned to limitation rather than sufficiency.

She paused outside Telman's cottage, hearing Syrna's cheerful voice recounting the day's excitement to her younger brother. The child would have spent weeks in pain with a traditionally set bone. Instead, she had been restored within moments, free to continue her life without interruption.

Continuing her walk, Naimente passed Widow Lenna's cottage, where the old woman struggled daily with joint pain that herbs could only partially address. Beyond lived the cooper with his persistent cough, the blacksmith's daughter with her recurring seizures, the miller with his failing eyesight—all conditions she treated but couldn't cure with traditional methods.

With the power she now possessed, how many of these limitations might she overcome? How many more lives could she improve with greater resources? The thought of Allemarea's hospitals, which she knew only through travelers' tales, filled her mind—wards of suffering patients who might benefit from her abilities.

Her path took her past the village's small graveyard, where simple markers commemorated generations of inhabitants. Her parents lay there, victims of the fever epidemic she hadn't been skilled enough to treat. And in the corner, the smallest marker of all—Lyra's grave, the child who had died in her arms despite her best traditional efforts.

Would Lyra have survived if Naimente had possessed her current abilities? The question haunted her, though she already knew the answer. With the power she now commanded, Lyra would still be alive, would still be playing with her sister Maiya, would still have her future ahead of her.

That knowledge settled her decision more firmly than any argument could have done. The mark on her palm flared with warmth, not painful now but reassuring—a reminder of what she could accomplish if she embraced this path fully.

When she returned to her cottage, she found Aedil waiting, stoking the small hearth fire with practiced movements that had taught Naimente everything about reading flames—their color indicating temperature, their pattern suggesting which herbs would burn best for specific healing vapors.

"You've decided," the older woman stated, not bothering with questions.

"Yes." Naimente began gathering essential items—her best healing tools, rare herbs, personal mementos. "I'm going to Allemarea."

Aedil nodded, having expected no other answer. "The prince offers an exchange. Your skills for his patronage."

"It's more than that," Naimente objected. "He genuinely values healing knowledge. And he's arranged for the village to receive medical care in my absence."

"Convenient," Aedil remarked. "Though royal promises often change once their immediate purpose is served."

She rose, moving to help Naimente select appropriate herbs for the journey—a peace offering of sorts. As they worked side by side one last time, Aedil spoke carefully.

"The mark on your palm—it's changing you, whether you recognize it or not. The crimson in your eyes grows more prominent after each healing. Your moods affect flames now. Heat follows your emotions."

"Side effects," Naimente replied dismissively. "Manifestations of greater healing energy."

"Perhaps," Aedil acknowledged. "Or perhaps signs of what this power truly is." She selected a small blue crystal vial from her own collection, pressing it into Naimente's hand. "Water from Daecillaea's spring. If the heat ever threatens to consume rather than heal, use it."

Naimente accepted the vial reluctantly, more to appease her mentor than from any belief she would need it. "I know what I'm doing, Aedil. I know who I am and what I want to accomplish."

"You know who you were," Aedil corrected softly. "What you're becoming remains to be seen."

They continued preparing in silence, the weight of years shared and paths now diverging settling between them. Naimente carefully packed her healing journals, reference texts, and the small collection of rare remedies she had gathered over years.

"At least take this," Aedil said finally, offering a worn book bound in faded blue leather. "The old stories about the Furies—Daecillaea and Tarashren. Their ancient conflict." She hesitated. "There may be wisdom there about the nature of what flows through you now."

Naimente accepted the book, touched despite herself by Aedil's concern. "I'll write," she promised. "And when I've established myself, perhaps you could visit. See what I've accomplished before judging it."

"Perhaps," Aedil agreed, though her tone suggested doubt. She moved toward the door, then paused. "Promise me one thing, Naimente. When ambition and healing conflict—when you must choose between power and compassion—remember why you first became a healer. Remember the oath we both took to heal, not harm."

The words struck deeper than Naimente would admit. Despite her certainty, a flicker of doubt surfaced—quickly suppressed by the reassuring warmth of the power within her.

"I'll remember," she promised, meaning it in that moment. "This power exists to heal. That's all I want to use it for."

After Aedil left, Naimente completed her preparations, selecting only what could fit in two modest packs. Her life's possessions seemed surprisingly few when gathered together—a testament to the simplicity she was about to leave behind.

Before sleeping, she sat at her small table and penned a letter to Aedil, trying to articulate what couldn't be properly expressed in their earlier conversation.

*Aedil,*

*By the time you read this, I'll be on the road to Allemarea. I know you believe I'm making a mistake, but I ask you to consider that this journey might be exactly what I'm meant to undertake.*

*I've never forgotten the day we lost Lyra—how helpless we felt as traditional methods failed her. The power I now possess could have saved her life. It has already saved Prince Aethen and healed Syrna's arm. How can I justify keeping such ability confined to our small village when so many others suffer?*

*You fear the changes you see in me. I understand your concern but believe you misinterpret what's happening. This power doesn't corrupt—it amplifies. It makes me more effective as a healer, not less compassionate.*

*I promise to uphold the principles you taught me. I will use my abilities to heal, to ease suffering, to improve lives. I will remember where I came from, and when I have influence, I will use it to ensure villages like ours receive the care they deserve.*

*This isn't goodbye. It's the beginning of something better for both of us, for our village, and for many others who will benefit from what I can offer.*

*With respect and gratitude for all you've taught me,*
*Naimente*

She sealed the letter and placed it where Aedil would find it tomorrow. The words felt true as she wrote them—her intentions were genuinely focused on healing, on using her abilities to help others. The nagging whisper of doubt, the subtle awareness of how the power's warmth felt increasingly pleasurable in her veins, she pushed aside as irrelevant distractions.

As she settled onto her bed for one last night in the cottage, the flame mark on her palm pulsed with a gentle, insistent heat. Since accepting Tarashren's gift, she had found sleep increasingly elusive, her mind filled with visions of flame and transformation. Tonight was no different—she lay awake, imagining the possibilities that awaited in Allemarea, barely noticing how the small flame in her hearth seemed to dance in rhythm with her heartbeat.

* * *

Morning brought a light mist over Merrow's Hollow, softening familiar buildings and lending the village an ethereal quality. Naimente emerged from her cottage to find several villagers already gathered to bid her farewell.

"Take care at that fancy court," Widow Lenna instructed, pressing a small package of honey cakes into Naimente's hands. "Don't let them make you forget us."

"I won't," Naimente promised, touched by the gesture.

"My Syrna's arm works perfect," Telman said, approaching with his daughter beside him. "Like it was never broken. If you can do that for folk in Allemarea, you should go with our blessing."

Others offered similar sentiments—pride in their healer being recognized, mixed with concern about her absence. Maiya, Lyra's older sister who now worked in the mill, approached last, pressing something into Naimente's hand—a small carved wooden pendant, roughly shaped like a flame.

"My sister would be happy knowing you might save others like her," she said simply.

Naimente's throat tightened unexpectedly. "I'll carry this with me always," she promised, hanging the pendant alongside the royal medallion Aethen had given her—symbols of her past and future hanging together against her heart.

Aedil stood apart from the others, her expression unreadable. When Naimente approached her, the older woman simply nodded, her earlier arguments exhausted.

"I left you a letter," Naimente said.

"I know who you are, child," Aedil replied quietly. "I only hope you remember when that becomes difficult."

Before Naimente could respond, the royal carriage appeared, with Prince Aethen walking alongside rather than riding within—another gesture that contradicted expectations of royal behavior. He greeted the gathered villagers warmly before approaching Naimente.

"You've decided?" he asked, though her packed belongings answered the question.

"Yes," Naimente confirmed. "I accept your invitation to demonstrate my healing methods at court."

Aethen smiled, genuine pleasure lighting his features. "Excellent. I've already sent instructions to prepare suitable accommodations."

He turned to Aedil, surprising the older healer with a respectful bow. "Your apprentice brings honor to your teaching. I promise she will have every opportunity to develop her abilities in Allemarea."

Aedil's weathered face remained impassive. "See that she remains who she is, Your Highness. That would be honor enough."

If Aethen found the response unusual, he didn't show it. Instead, he nodded gravely, as if accepting a solemn charge. "I'll do my best," he replied, and something in his tone suggested he understood more than his courtly manner revealed.

Naimente's belongings were loaded onto the carriage, and farewells completed with surprising quickness. As she prepared to enter the conveyance—her first time in such a vehicle—she took a final look at Merrow's Hollow, trying to memorize its contours against the morning mist.

Aethen, observing her hesitation, spoke quietly. "You're not abandoning them. You're extending your ability to help beyond these boundaries."

The words articulated exactly what she needed to hear, aligning perfectly with her own justifications. She glanced at him with renewed appreciation for his perception.

"Yes," she agreed. "That's precisely it."

As the carriage began moving, Naimente looked back at the diminishing figures of the villagers. Aedil stood motionless, a solitary figure framed against the morning sky, watching until they disappeared around the bend in the road.

Inside the carriage, Naimente settled across from Prince Aethen, acutely aware of the luxury surrounding her—velvet cushions, carved wood panels, small crystal lamps. Everything spoke of a world where resources weren't carefully rationed, where beauty existed alongside function rather than being sacrificed for necessity.

"The journey takes most of a day," Aethen explained. "We'll reach Allemarea by evening." He appeared more relaxed away from the village, his movements more natural. He reached into a compartment and withdrew a slim sketchbook, offering it to her. "I thought you might be interested."

Naimente opened it, finding page after page of detailed drawings—not landscapes or court scenes as she might have expected, but medical subjects. Anatomical studies. Healing herbs rendered with scientific precision. And most surprising, a series of sketches showing her hands during the healing process, capturing the subtle glow that had surrounded them.

"You have a healer's eye," she said, genuinely impressed by his attention to detail.

"An artist's eye," he corrected modestly. "I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and healing—how both require careful observation and seek to transform what they touch." He hesitated, then added, "When you healed me, I saw something extraordinary—patterns beneath your skin, like fire following the pathways of your veins. I've tried to capture it in these drawings."

She studied the sketches more carefully, recognizing the accuracy of his perception. He had seen what others missed—the physical manifestation of the power flowing through her. Rather than frightening him, it had fascinated him.

"The court will be overwhelming at first," he continued, changing subjects smoothly. "Allemarea itself is unlike anywhere else in the region—the great waterfall, the hanging gardens, the ancient architecture. But beneath its beauty, there's suffering like anywhere else. Perhaps more, hidden behind grand facades."

"I look forward to seeing it," Naimente replied, though a flutter of apprehension accompanied the words. What awaited her in Allemarea went beyond magnificent sights—it represented opportunity, yes, but also unknown challenges and dangers.

The mark on her palm warmed reassuringly, as if reminding her of the power she carried. Whatever awaited in Allemarea, she would face it with abilities beyond ordinary healers. She would prove her worth—to the court, to Aedil, and to herself.

As the carriage rolled forward, taking her toward a future bright with promise and shadow, Naimente felt herself crossing a threshold. Behind lay the certainty of village life with its familiar limitations. Ahead lay Allemarea, with its grand waterfall, its decadent court, its suffering patients waiting for healing beyond traditional methods.

She had chosen her path. Now she would walk it with absolute determination, whatever the cost.

She glanced out the window at the receding landscape of her childhood, then back at Aethen, who was now sketching the passing scenery with quick, sure strokes. The connection between them remained inexplicable yet undeniable—as if their meeting had been arranged by forces beyond their understanding.

The flame mark on her palm pulsed in agreement, warm and seductive, whispering of all that was to come.
